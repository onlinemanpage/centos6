<p>cdrecord_selinux(8) cdrecord SELinux Policy
documentation cdrecord_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME cdrecord_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the cdrecord pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures cdrecord (Policy for
cdrecord) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. cdrecord policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run cdrecord with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow cdrecord to read various content.
nfs, samba, removable devices, user temp and untrusted
content file, you must turn on the cdrecord_read_content
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cdrecord_read_content 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cdrecord policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cdrecord processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for cdrecord:</p>

<p>cdrecord_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cdrecord_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the cdrecord_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/cdrecord, /usr/bin/wodim,
/usr/bin/growisofs</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cdrecord policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cdrecord processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cdrecord:</p>

<p>cdrecord_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
