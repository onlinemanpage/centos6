<p>prelink_selinux(8) prelink SELinux Policy documentation
prelink_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME prelink_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the prelink pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures prelink (Prelink ELF
shared library mappings) processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux prelink policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their prelink processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for prelink:</p>

<p>prelink_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_cache_t type, if you want
to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>prelink_cron_system_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_cron_system_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
prelink_cron_system_t domain.</p>

<p>prelink_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the prelink_t domain.</p>

<p>prelink_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as prelink log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/prelink(/.*)?, /var/log/prelink.log</p>

<p>prelink_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_tmp_t type, if you want to
store prelink temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>prelink_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store prelink files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>prelink_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the prelink_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the prelink files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/prelink(/.*)?,
/var/lib/misc/prelink.*</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux prelink policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their prelink processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for prelink:</p>

<p>prelink_cron_system_t, prelink_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
