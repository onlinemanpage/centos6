<p>fprintd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
fprintd fprintd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME fprintd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the fprintd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fprintd
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The fprintd processes execute with the fprintd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep fprintd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The fprintd_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;fprintd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the fprintd_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/libexec/fprintd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux fprintd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their fprintd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for fprintd:</p>

<p>fprintd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a fprintd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type fprintd_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux fprintd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their fprintd processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for fprintd:</p>

<p>fprintd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fprintd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the fprintd_t domain.</p>

<p>fprintd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fprintd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the fprintd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type fprintd_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>fprintd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/fprint(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
