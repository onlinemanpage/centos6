<p>mplayer_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
mplayer mplayer_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mplayer_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the mplayer pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mplayer
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The mplayer processes execute with the mplayer_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep mplayer_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The mplayer_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mplayer_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the mplayer_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/vlc, /usr/bin/xine, /usr/bin/mplayer</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mplayer:</p>

<p>mplayer_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a mplayer_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type mplayer_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. mplayer policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run mplayer with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must
turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must
turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mplayer:</p>

<p>mplayer_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_etc_t type, if you want to
store mplayer files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>mplayer_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mplayer_t domain.</p>

<p>mplayer_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_home_t type, if you want to
store mplayer files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>mplayer_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mplayer_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store mplayer files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type mplayer_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>mplayer_home_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.mplayer(/.*)?</p>

<p>mplayer_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>user_fonts_cache_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.fonts/auto(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.fontconfig(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.fonts.cache-.*</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
