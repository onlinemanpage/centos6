<p>NAME ipa-replica-install - Create an IPA replica</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-replica-install [OPTION]...
replica_file</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Configures a new IPA server that is a
replica of the server that gener- ated it. Once it has been
created it is an exact copy of the original IPA server and
is an equal master. Changes made to any master are auto-
matically replicated to other masters.</p>

<p>The replica_file is created using the
ipa-replica-prepare utility.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d, --debug Enable debug logging when more
verbose output is needed</p>

<p>-n, --no-ntp Do not configure NTP</p>

<p>-p, --password=DM_PASSWORD Directory Manager (existing
master) password</p>

<p>--setup-dns Generate a DNS zone if it does not exist
already and configure the DNS server. This option requires
that you either specify at least one DNS forwarder through
the --forwarder option or use the --no-forwarders
option.</p>

<p>--forwarder=IP_ADDRESS Add a DNS forwarder to the DNS
configuration. You can use this option multiple times to
specify more forwarders, but at least one must be provided,
unless the --no-forwarders option is spec- ified.</p>

<p>--no-forwarders Do not add any DNS forwarders. Root DNS
servers will be used instead.</p>

<p>--no-host-dns Do not use DNS for hostname lookup during
installation</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>
