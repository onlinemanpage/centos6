<p>rpm_selinux(8) rpm SELinux Policy documentation
rpm_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME rpm_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the rpm processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures rpm (Policy for the
RPM package manager) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux rpm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rpm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for rpm:</p>

<p>rpm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the rpm_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/yum-updatesd, /usr/bin/apt-get,
/usr/libexec/yumDBUS- Backend.py, /usr/libexec/packagekitd,
/usr/sbin/rhn_check, /usr/bin/rpmdev-rmdevelrpms,
/usr/sbin/synaptic, /usr/share/yumex/yumex-yum-backend,
/usr/sbin/pirut, /usr/sbin/pup, /usr/bin/apt-shell,
/usr/sbin/up2date, /usr/bin/fedora-rmdevelrpms, /bin/rpm,
/usr/sbin/packagekitd, /usr/bin/yum,
/usr/sbin/system-install-packages, /usr/bin/rpm,
/usr/sbin/yum-complete-transaction, /usr/bin/smart,
/usr/sbin/rhn- reg_ks, /usr/share/yumex/yum_childtask.py</p>

<p>rpm_file_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_file_t type, if you want to
treat the files as rpm content.</p>

<p>rpm_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as rpm log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/yum.log.*, /var/log/rpmpkgs.*</p>

<p>rpm_script_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_script_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the rpm_script_t domain.</p>

<p>rpm_script_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_script_tmp_t type, if you want
to store rpm script temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>rpm_script_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_script_tmpfs_t type, if you
want to store rpm script files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>rpm_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_tmp_t type, if you want to
store rpm temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>rpm_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store rpm files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>rpm_var_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_var_cache_t type, if you want
to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/yum(/.*)?,
/var/spool/up2date(/.*)?</p>

<p>rpm_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the rpm files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/yum(/.*)?, /var/lib/rpm(/.*)?,
/var/lib/alterna- tives(/.*)?</p>

<p>rpm_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rpm_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the rpm files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/PackageKit(/.*)?, /var/run/yum.*</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux rpm policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their rpm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for rpm:</p>

<p>rpm_t, rpm_script_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
