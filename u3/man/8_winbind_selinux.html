<p>winbind_selinux(8) winbind SELinux Policy documentation
winbind_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME winbind_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the winbind pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. winbind policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run winbind with the tightest
access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Apache to use mod_auth_ntlm_winbin,
you must turn on the allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux winbind policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their winbind processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for winbind:</p>

<p>winbind_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the winbind_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the winbind_t domain.</p>

<p>winbind_helper_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the winbind_helper_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the winbind_helper_t
domain.</p>

<p>winbind_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the winbind_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as winbind log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>winbind_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the winbind_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the winbind files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/samba/winbindd_privileged(/.*)?,
/var/lib/samba/win- bindd_privileged(/.*)?,
/var/run/winbindd(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux winbind policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their winbind processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for winbind:</p>

<p>winbind_helper_t, winbind_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
