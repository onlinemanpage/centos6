<p>mysqld_selinux(8) mysqld SELinux Policy documentation
mysqld_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mysqld_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mysqld pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. mysqld policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run mysqld with the tightest
access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow users to connect to mysq, you must
turn on the allow_user_mysql_connect boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_user_mysql_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow mysqld to connect to all port, you
must turn on the mysql_connect_any boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P mysql_connect_any 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mysqld policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mysqld processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mysqld:</p>

<p>mysqld_db_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_db_t type, if you want to
treat the files as mysqld database content.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/squeezeboxserver(/.*)?,
/var/lib/mysql(/.*)?</p>

<p>mysqld_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_etc_t type, if you want to
store mysqld files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/my.cnf, /etc/mysql(/.*)?</p>

<p>mysqld_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mysqld_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/libexec/mysqld, /usr/sbin/mysqld(-max)?</p>

<p>mysqld_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the mysqld_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>mysqld_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as mysqld log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>mysqld_safe_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_safe_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the mysqld_safe_t
domain.</p>

<p>mysqld_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_tmp_t type, if you want to
store mysqld temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>mysqld_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mysqld_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the mysqld files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/mysqld(/.*)?,
/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux mysqld policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mysqld processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for mysqld:</p>

<p>mysqld_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>mysqlmanagerd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mysqld policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their mysqld processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mysqld:</p>

<p>mysqld_safe_t, mysqlmanagerd_t, mysqld_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
