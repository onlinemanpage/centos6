<p>NAME openvswitch_ovsdb_server_selinux - Security
Enhanced Linux Policy for the openvswitch_ovsdb_server
processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
openvswitch_ovsdb_server processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>The openvswitch_ovsdb_server processes execute with the
open- vswitch_ovsdb_server_t SELinux type. You can check if
you have these processes running by executing the ps command
with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t SELinux type
can be entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type,openvswitch_ovsdb_server_exec_t&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the
openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/usr/sbin/ovsdb-server</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux openvswitch_ovsdb_server policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their
openvswitch_ovsdb_server processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
openvswitch_ovsdb_server:</p>

<p>openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a
openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type
openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t permis- sive. Permissive process
types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will
still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux openvswitch_ovsdb_server policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their
openvswitch_ovsdb_server processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
openvswitch_ovsdb_server:</p>

<p>openvswitch_ovsdb_server_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvswitch_ovsdb_server_exec_t
type, if you want to transition an executable to the
openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
openvswitch_ovsdb_server_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
