<p>NAME libguestfs-test-tool - Diagnostics for
libguestfs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS libguestfs-test-tool [--options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION libguestfs-test-tool is a test program
shipped with libguestfs to allow you to check basic
libguestfs functionality is working. This is needed because
libguestfs occasionally breaks for reasons beyond our
control: usually because of changes in the underlying qemu
or kernel packages, or the host environment.</p>

<p>If you suspect a problem in libguestfs, then just
run:</p>

<p>libguestfs-test-tool</p>

<p>It will print lots of diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>If it runs to completion successfully, you will see this
near the end:</p>

<p>===== TEST FINISHED OK =====</p>

<p>and the test tool will exit with code 0.</p>

<p>If it fails (and/or exits with non-zero error code),
please paste the complete, unedited output of the test tool
into a bug report. More information about reporting bugs can
be found on the &lt;http://libguestfs.org/&gt; website.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display short usage information and
exit.</p>

<p>--qemu qemu_binary If you have downloaded another qemu
binary, point this option at the full path of the binary to
try it.</p>

<p>--qemudir qemu_source_dir If you have compiled qemu from
source, point this option at the source directory to try
it.</p>

<p>-t N --timeout N Set the launch timeout to &quot;N&quot;
seconds. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes) which does
not usually need to be adjusted.</p>

<p>TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU If you have
compiled another version of qemu from source and would like
to try that, then you can use the --qemudir option to point
to the qemu source directory.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded a qemu binary from somewhere, use
the --qemu option to point to the binary.</p>

<p>Note when using these options, you can ignore the
business of qemu wrapper scripts (&quot;QEMU WRAPPERS&quot;
in guestfs(3)), since libguestfs-test- tool writes a wrapper
script for you if one is needed.</p>

<p>TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT KERNEL If you are using
febootstrap 3.8 then you can select which kernel libguestfs
tries. You do this by setting the environment variables
&quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL&quot; and/or
&quot;FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES&quot;.</p>

<p>Refer to &quot;ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES&quot; in
febootstrap-supermin-helper(8) for further information.</p>

<p>SELF-DIAGNOSIS Refer to &quot;APPLIANCE BOOT
PROCESS&quot; in guestfs(3) to understand the messages
produced by libguestfs-test-tool and/or possible errors.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS libguestfs-test-tool returns 0 if the tests
completed without error, or 1 if there was an error.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES For the full list of environment
variables which may affect libguestfs, please see the
guestfs(3) manual page.</p>
