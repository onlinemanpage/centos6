<p>ssh_selinux(8) ssh SELinux Policy documentation
ssh_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ssh_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the ssh processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures ssh (Secure shell
client and server policy) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. ssh policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run ssh with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow ssh with chroot env to read and
write files in the user home directorie, you must turn on
the ssh_chroot_rw_homedirs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P ssh_chroot_rw_homedirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ssh logins as sysadm_r:sysadm_, you
must turn on the ssh_sysadm_login boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P ssh_sysadm_login 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow host key based authenticatio, you
must turn on the allow_ssh_keysign boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ssh_keysign 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow fenced domain to execute ssh, you
must turn on the fenced_can_ssh boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fenced_can_ssh 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ssh policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ssh processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ssh:</p>

<p>ssh_agent_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_agent_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the ssh_agent_t domain.</p>

<p>ssh_agent_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_agent_tmp_t type, if you want
to store ssh agent temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>ssh_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the ssh_t domain.</p>

<p>ssh_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_home_t type, if you want to
store ssh files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/gitolite/.ssh(/.*)?, /root/.shosts,
/var/lib/amanda/.ssh(/.*)?, /root/.ssh(/.*)?</p>

<p>ssh_keygen_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_keygen_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the ssh_keygen_t domain.</p>

<p>ssh_keysign_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_keysign_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the ssh_keysign_t
domain.</p>

<p>ssh_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ssh_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store ssh files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>sshd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the sshd_t domain.</p>

<p>sshd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the sshd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>sshd_key_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_key_t type, if you want to
treat the files as sshd key data.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key,
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub,
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key,
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key.pub,
/etc/ssh/primes</p>

<p>sshd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>sshd_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store sshd files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>sshd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sshd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the sshd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux ssh policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ssh processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for ssh:</p>

<p>ssh_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ssh policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their ssh processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for ssh:</p>

<p>ssh_keysign_t, ssh_keygen_t, ssh_t, sshd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
