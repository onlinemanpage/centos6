<p>NAME checkpolicy_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the checkpol- icy processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
checkpolicy processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The checkpolicy processes execute with the checkpolicy_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep checkpolicy_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The checkpolicy_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;checkpol- icy_exec_t&quot; file type.
The default entrypoint paths for the checkpol- icy_t domain
are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/checkpolicy</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux checkpolicy policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their checkpolicy processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
checkpolicy:</p>

<p>checkpolicy_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a checkpolicy_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type checkpolicy_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux checkpolicy policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their checkpolicy processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
checkpolicy:</p>

<p>checkpolicy_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the checkpolicy_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the checkpolicy_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type checkpolicy_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>semanage_store_t</p>

<p>/etc/selinux/([^/]*/)?policy(/.*)?
/etc/selinux/([^/]*/)?modules/(active|tmp|previous)(/.*)?
/etc/share/selinux/mls(/.*)?
/etc/share/selinux/targeted(/.*)?</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
