<p>NAME setroubleshoot_fixit_selinux - Security Enhanced
Linux Policy for the setroubleshoot_fixit processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
setroubleshoot_fixit processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The setroubleshoot_fixit processes execute with the
setrou- bleshoot_fixit_t SELinux type. You can check if you
have these pro- cesses running by executing the ps command
with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep setroubleshoot_fixit_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The setroubleshoot_fixit_t SELinux type can
be entered via the &quot;setrou- bleshoot_fixit_exec_t&quot;
file type. The default entrypoint paths for the
setroubleshoot_fixit_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/share/setroubleshoot/SetroubleshootFixit.py*</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux setroubleshoot_fixit policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot_fixit processes
in as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
setroubleshoot_fixit:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a setroubleshoot_fixit_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type
setroubleshoot_fixit_t permissive. Permissive process types
are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux setroubleshoot_fixit policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot_fixit
processes in as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
setroubleshoot_fixit:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
setroubleshoot_fixit_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
setroubleshoot_fixit_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
