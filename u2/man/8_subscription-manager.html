<p>subscription-manager(8) Subscription Management
subscription-manager(8)</p>

<p>NAME subscription-manager - Register machines and manage
subscriptions to products.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS subscription-manager command [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION subscription-manager is a client program
that registers a system with the Certificate-Based Red Hat
Network. To register your system with RHN Classic or with an
RHN Satellite 5.x system, then use the rhn_register
tool.</p>

<p>Red Hat provides content updates and support by issuing
subscriptions for its products. These subscriptions are
allocated to systems (machines); once a system is subscribed
to content, it is entitled to install and update that
software product. IT administrators need to track these
subscriptions and how they are assigned. This entitlement
and subscription management is a feature available for Red
Hat plat- forms version 5.7 (and later) and version 6.1 (and
later).</p>

<p>For RHEL systems, content is delivered through the Red
Hat Customer Portal. Subscriptions and systems are managed
globally through the Red Hat entitlement service, which is
integrated with the Customer Portal. Subscriptions are
managed for the local system by using the Red Hat
Subscription Manager tool. Subscription Manager is a local
client which connects a system with the entitlement
service.</p>

<p>subscription-manager is the command-line based client
for the Red Hat Subscription Manager tool.</p>

<p>The Subscription Manager performs several key
operations:</p>

<p>* It registers machines to the Red Hat entitlement
service and adds the machine to the systems inventory. Once
a machine is registered, it can receive updates based on its
subscriptions to any kind of software products.</p>

<p>* It lists both available and used (consumed)
subscriptions.</p>

<p>* It allows administrators to both subscribe and
unsubscribe a system from specific subscriptions.</p>

<p>Subscription Manager can be used to autosubscribe a
system, as well. The subscription-manager command can even
be invoked as part of a kick- start process.</p>

<p>Available subscriptions are based on the specific
information about the machine s architecture. An entitlement
is only considered available if the platform and hardware
can support that specific product.</p>

<p>Subscription Manager also collects and summarizes system
facts related it its hardware, operating system, and other
characteristics. These facts can be edited in the
Subscription Manager configuration and displayed through
Subscription Manager.</p>

<p>There is also a Subscription Manager GUI, which can be
invoked simply by running subscription-manager-gui from the
command line.</p>

<p>Entitlement and subscription management is only
available for RHEL 5.7/6.1 and later systems. Older systems
should register to Red Hat Network Classic using the
rhn_register command.</p>

<p>COMMANDS AND OPTIONS subscription-manager has specific
options available for each command, depending on what
operation is being performed. The Subscription Man- ager
commands are related to the different subscription
operations:</p>

<p>1. register</p>

<p>2. unregister</p>

<p>3. subscribe</p>

<p>4. unsubscribe</p>

<p>5. import</p>

<p>6. redeem</p>

<p>7. list</p>

<p>8. refresh</p>

<p>9. environments</p>

<p>10. repos</p>

<p>11. orgs</p>

<p>12. identity</p>

<p>13. facts</p>

<p>14. clean</p>

<p>15. config</p>

<p>COMMON OPTIONS -h, --help Prints the specific help
information for the given command.</p>

<p>--proxy=PROXY Uses an HTTP proxy. The PROXY name has the
format hostname:port.</p>

<p>--proxyuser=PROXYUSERNAME Gives the username to use to
authenticate to the HTTP proxy.</p>

<p>--proxypass=PROXYPASSWORD Gives the password to use to
authenticate to the HTTP proxy.</p>

<p>REGISTER OPTIONS The register command registers a new
machine to the entitlement ser- vice.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
which is registering the sys- tem; this user account is
usually tied to the user account for the content delivery
system which supplies the content. Optional, for user-based
authentication.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.
This is required.</p>

<p>--type=CONSUMERTYPE Sets the type of consumer to
register. Most systems will use the default value of system.
For development or test systems, this can be person , which
indicates a personal (rather than organizational)
entitlement subscription. Other systems can be candlepin for
a local content service or domain for an IP domain.</p>

<p>--name=CONSUMERNAME Sets the name of the consumer
(machine) to register. This defaults to be the same as the
hostname.</p>

<p>--consumerid=CONSUMERID References an existing consumer
ID to reregister a system. The consumer ID is used as an
inventory number for the system in the entitlements service
database. If the entitlements data are lost or corrupted,
reregistering the system restores it.</p>

<p>--activationkey=KEYS Gives a comma-separated list of
product keys to use to redeem or apply specific
subscriptions to the machine. This is used gener- ally for
preconfigured machines, which may already have products
installed and subscriptions allocated for that consumer.</p>

<p>When the --activationkey option is used, it is not
necessary to use the --username and --password options,
because the authentication informa- tion is implicit in the
activation key.</p>

<p>In hosted or single organization environments, it is not
necessary to specify an organization with the --org option,
but in multi-organiza- tion environments, this is
required.</p>

<p>For example: subscription-manager register
--org=&quot;IT Dept&quot; --activationkey=1234abcd</p>

<p>Giving the org name is not necessary in hosted
environments or infras- tructures which have only a single
organization.</p>

<p>--autosubscribe Automatically subscribes this system to
the best-matched compat- ible subscription.</p>

<p>--force Registers the system even if it is already
registered. Normally, any register operations will fail if
the machine is already reg- istered. With --force, the
existing consumer entry is unregis- tered first, all of its
subscriptions are returned to the pool, and then the
consumer is registered as a new consumer.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Assigns the consumer to an organization.
Infrastructures which are managed on-site may be
multi-tenant, meaning that there are multiple organizations
within one customer unit. A consumer may be assigned
manually to one of these suborganizations. If there is only
one organization configured (which is the case with
infrastructures using the hosted service), then this is not
used. With multi-tenant environments, this is required.</p>

<p>--environment=ENV Registers the consumer to an
environment within an organization.</p>

<p>UNREGISTER OPTIONS The unregister command unregisters a
machine, which strips its sub- scriptions and removes the
machine from the entitlement service.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>SUBSCRIBE OPTIONS The subscribe command allocates a
specific subscription to the machine.</p>

<p>--pool=POOLID Gives the ID for the entitlements pool
(collection of products) to subscribe the machine to. This
option is required, unless --auto is used.</p>

<p>--quantity=NUMBER Subscribes the system to a specified
number of subscriptions. Subscriptions may have certain
limits on them, like the number of sockets on the machine or
the number of allowed virtual guests. It is possible to
assign multiple subscriptions (or stacking subscriptions) to
cover the number of sockets, guests, or other
characteristic.</p>

<p>--auto Automatically subscribes this system to the
best-matched compat- ible subscription or subscriptions.</p>

<p>UNSUBSCRIBE OPTIONS The unsubscribe command removes a
subscription allocation from the machine. (This does not
uninstall the associated products.)</p>

<p>--serial=SERIALNUMBER Gives the serial number of the
entitlement certificate for the specific product that is
being unsubscribed. Entitlement cer- tificates for
subscribed products are in a certificate, in
/etc/pki/entitlement/&lt;serial_number&gt;.pem.</p>

<p>--all Unsubscribes the system from all of the products
it s subscribed to.</p>

<p>IMPORT OPTIONS The import command imports and applies an
entitlement certificate for the consumer which was generated
externally, such as in the Customer Portal, and then copied
over to the machine. Importing can be necessary if a machine
is pre-configured in the subscription service or if it is
offline or unable to access the subscription service but it
must be properly subscribed to relevant entitlements.</p>

<p>--certificate=CERTIFICATE_FILE Points to a certificate
PEM file which contains the entitlement certificate. This
can be mused multiple times to import multiple entitlement
certificates.</p>

<p>REDEEM OPTIONS The redeem command is used for machines
that are purchased from third- party vendors that include a
subscription. The redemption process essentially
autosubscribes the machine to the pre-selected subscription
that the vendor supplied.</p>

<p>--email=EMAIL Gives the email account to send the
redemption notification mes- sage to.</p>

<p>--locale=LOCALE Sets the locale to use for the message.
If none is given, then it defaults to the local systems
locale.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Identifies the organization which issued the
entitlement being redeemed.</p>

<p>LIST OPTIONS The list command lists all of the
subscriptions that are compatible with a machine. The
options allow the list to be filtered by subscrip- tions
that are used by the machine or unused subscriptions that
are available to the machine.</p>

<p>--available Lists available subscriptions which the
machine has not sub- scribed to.</p>

<p>--consumed Lists all of the subscriptions that the
machine is currently subscribed to.</p>

<p>--ondate=YYYY-MM-DD Sets the date to use to search for
active and available sub- scriptions. The default (if not
explicitly passed) is todays date; using a later date looks
for subscriptions which will be active then. This is only
used with the --available option.</p>

<p>--installed Lists products which are currently installed
on the system which may (or may not) have subscriptions
associated with them, as well as subscribed products which
may (or may not) be installed.</p>

<p>--all Lists all possible subscriptions that have been
purchased by the organization, even if they don t match the
architecture of the system. This is used with the
--available option.</p>

<p>REFRESH OPTIONS The refresh command pulls the latest
entitlement data from the server. Normally, the system polls
the entitlement server at a set interval (4 hours by
default) to check for any changes in the available subscrip-
tions. The refresh command checks with the entitlement
server right then, outside the normal interval.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTS OPTIONS The environments command lists all
of the environments that have been configured for an
organization. This command is only used for organiza- tions
which have a locally-hosted subscriptions or content service
of some kind, like Katello and Subscription Asset Manager.
The concept of environments -- and therefore this command --
have no meaning in a hosted subscription/content
structure.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
to use to connect to the organization account.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.
This is required.</p>

<p>--org=ORG Identifies the organization for which to list
the configured environments.</p>

<p>REPOS OPTIONS The repos command lists all of the
repositories that are available to a consumer. This command
is only used for organizations which have a locally-hosted
content service of some kind, like Katello. With Red Hat s
hosted content service, there is only one central
repository.</p>

<p>--list Lists all of the repositories that are provided
by the content service used by the consumer.</p>

<p>ORGS OPTIONS The orgs command lists all of the
organizations which are available to the specified user
accounts. A multi-tenant infrastructure may have multiple
organizations within a single customer, and users may be
restricted to access only a subset of the total number of
organiza- tions.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
to use to connect to the organization account.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.
This is required.</p>

<p>IDENTITY OPTIONS The identity command handles the UUID
of a system, which identifies the system to the entitlement
service after registration. This command can simply return
the UUID or it can be used to restore the registration of a
previously-registered system to the entitlement service.</p>

<p>--regenerate Requests that the entitlement service issue
a new identity cer- tificate for the system, using an
existing UUID in the original identity certificate. If this
is used alone, then the identity command also uses the
original identity certificate to bind to the entitlement
server, using certificate-based authentication.</p>

<p>--username=USERNAME Gives the username for the account
which is registering the sys- tem; this user account is
usually tied to the user account for the content delivery
system which supplies the content. Optional, for user-based
authentication.</p>

<p>--password=PASSWORD Gives the user account password.
Optional, for user-based authentication.</p>

<p>--force Regenerates the identity certificate for the
system using user- name/password authentication. This is
used with the --regenerate option. --regenerate alone will
use an existing identity cer- tificate to authenticate to
the entitlement service. If the cer- tificate is missing or
corrupted or in other circumstances, then it may be better
to use user authentication rather than certifi- cate-based
authentication. In that case, the --force option requires
the username or password to be given either as an argu- ment
or in response to a prompt.</p>

<p>FACTS OPTIONS The facts command lists the system
information, like the release ver- sion, number of CPUs, and
other architecture information.</p>

<p>--list Lists the system information. These are simple
attribute: value pairs that reflect much of the information
in the /etc/sysconfig directory cpu.architecture: x86_64
cpu.core(s)_per_socket: 1 cpu.cpu(s): 2 cpu.cpu_family: 6
cpu.cpu_mhz: 1861.776 cpu.cpu_op-mode(s): 64-bit
cpu.cpu_socket(s): 2 cpu.hypervisor_vendor: KVM cpu.model: 2
cpu.numa_node(s): 1 cpu.numa_node0_cpu(s): 0,1 cpu.stepping:
3 cpu.thread(s)_per_core: 1 cpu.vendor_id: GenuineIntel
cpu.virtualization_type: full distribution.id: Santiago
distribution.name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation
distribution.version: 6.1 ----</p>

<p>--update Updates the system information. This is
particularly important whenever there is a hardware change
(such as adding a CPU) or a system upgrade because these
changes can affect the subscrip- tions that are compatible
with the system.</p>

<p>CLEAN OPTIONS The clean command removes all of the
subscription and identity data from the local system without
affecting the consumer information in the entitlement
service. This means that any of the subscriptions consumed
by the system are still consumed and are not available for
other sys- tems to use. The clean command is useful in cases
where the local enti- tlement information is corrupted or
lost somehow, and the system will be reregistered using the
register --consumerid=EXISTING_ID command.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>CONFIG OPTIONS The config command changes the rhsm.conf
configuration file used by Subscription Manager. Almost all
of the connection information used by Subscription Manager
to access the subscription server, content server, and any
proxies is set in the configuration file, as well as general
configuration parameters like the frequency Subscription
Manager checks for entitlements updates. There are major
divisions in the rhsm.conf file, such as [server] which is
used to configure the subscription server. When changing the
Subscription Manager configuration, the set- tings are
identified with the format section.name and then the new
value. For example:
server.hostname=newsubscription.example.com</p>

<p>--list Prints the current configuration for Subscription
Manager.</p>

<p>--remove=section.name Deletes the current value for the
parameter without supplying a new parameter. A blank value
tells Subscription Manager to use service default values for
that parameter. If there no defaults, then the feature is
ignored.</p>

<p>--section.name=VALUE Sets a parameter to a new,
specified value. This is commonly used for connection
settings:</p>

<p>* server.hostname (subscription server)</p>

<p>* server.proxy</p>

<p>* server.proxy_port</p>

<p>* server.proxy_user</p>

<p>* server.proxy_password</p>

<p>* rhsm.baseurl (content server)</p>

<p>* rhsm.certFrequency</p>

<p>USAGE subscription-manager has two major tasks:</p>

<p>1. Handling the registration for a given system to an
entitle- ment service</p>

<p>2. Handling the product subscriptions for a machine.</p>

<p>subscription-manager makes it easier for network
administrators to maintain parity between software
subscriptions and updates and their installed products by
tracking and managing what machines are sub- scribed to and
when those subscriptions expire or are exceeded.</p>

<p>REGISTERING AND UNREGISTERING MACHINES A machine is
either registered to an entitlement and content service --
which makes all of the subscriptions available to the
machine -- or it is not registered. Unregistered machines
necessarily lack valid soft- ware entitlements because there
is no way to record that the subscrip- tions have been used
or to renew them.</p>

<p>Machines are usually registered to an entitlement
service as part of their initial configuration, such as the
firstboot or kickstart pro- cess. However, machines can be
registered manually after they are con- figured, can be
removed from a content service, or reregistered.</p>

<p>If a machine has never been registered (not even during
firstboot), then the register command will register the
machine with whatever enti- tlement service is configured in
the /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf file. This command requires, at a
minimum, the username and password for an account to connect
to the entitlement service. If the credentials arent passed
with the command, then subscription-manager prompts for the
username and password interactively.</p>

<p>For an environment with a single organization -- such as
a hosted sys- tem -- all that is required is the
username/password set. For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret</p>

<p>For a multi-tenant environment, then it is also
necessary to specify the organization to which to register
the system. For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;</p>

<p>Some information is assigned automatically. Subscription
Manager auto- matically generates a unique consumer ID for
the system which is used by the entitlement service and it
assigns a consumer type, which indi- cates what kinds of
software are available for the machine. The name for the
consumer entry can be manually assigned (for use within a
local inventory system, for instance). A handful of
subscriptions (such as specialized servers for content or
identity management) have their own specific consumer type.
For example:</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --type=system --name=server1
--org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;</p>

<p>If a system is in a multi-tenant environment and the
organization is not provided with the registration request,
registration fails with a remote server error. In the
rhsm.log, there will be errors about being unable to load
the owners interface.</p>

<p>If a system is registered and then somehow its
entitlement information is lost -- a drive crashes or the
certificates are deleted or corrupted -- the system can be
reregistered, with all of its subscriptions restored, by
registering with the existing consumer ID.</p>

<p>subscription-manager register --username=admin
--password=secret --consumerid=1234abcd</p>

<p>A consumer uses an SSL client certificate (its identity
certificate) to authenticate to the entitlements system to
check for updates or changes to subscriptions. If the
identity certificate is lost or corrupted, it can be
regenerated using the identity command. subscription-manager
identity --regenerate</p>

<p>Using the --force option will prompt for the username
and password for the account, if one isnt given, and then
return the new consumer ID and the hostname of the
registered system.</p>

<p>subscription-manager identity --force Username: jsmith
Password: eff9a4c9-3579-49e5-a52f-83f2db29ab52
server.example.com</p>

<p>A machine is unregistered and removed as a consumer from
the entitle- ments service simply by running the unregister
command. Unregistering and unsubscribing a service can free
up entitlement subscriptions when a machine is taken offline
or moved to a different department. subscription-manager
unregister</p>

<p>LISTING, SUBSCRIBING, AND UNSUBSCRIBING TO PRODUCTS A
subscription is essentially the right to install, use, and
receive updates for a Red Hat product. (Sometimes multiple
individual software products are bundled together into a
single subscription.) When a machine is registered, the
entitlements and content service is aware of the machine and
has a list of all of the possible product subscriptions that
the machine can install and use. A machine is allocated a
product subscription by subscribing to the entitlement pool
that makes that product available. A machine releases that
entitlement (meaning, it unassigns that product so that
another machine can use that entitlement count) by
unsubscribing.</p>

<p>list command shows you what subscriptions are available
specifically to the system (meaning subscriptions which are
active, have available quantities, and match the hardware
and architecture) or all subscrip- tions for the
organization. Using the --ondate option shows subscrip-
tions that are or will be active at a specific time
(otherwise, it shows subscriptions which are active
today).</p>

<p>subscription-manager list --available
--ondate=2012-01-31
+-------------------------------------------+ Available
Subscriptions
+-------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>ProductName: Awesome OS Server ProductId: AOS001 PoolId:
8a90f88e2e3802ab012e380345de0203 Quantity: 5 Expires:
2012-02-17</p>

<p>The list command can also be used to show what products
you currently have installed, as a way of tracking what
products you have versus what subscriptions you have on the
machine. subscription-manager list --installed</p>

<p>+-------------------------------------------+ Installed
Product Status
+-------------------------------------------+</p>

<p>ProductName: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Entitlement
Status: Not Subscribed Expires: Subscription:
ContractNumber: AccountNumber:</p>

<p>ProductName: Awesome OS Server Status: Not Installed
Expires: 2012-02-20 Subscription: 54129829316535230
ContractNumber: 39 AccountNumber: 12331131231</p>

<p>Subscribing a machine requires the ID for the
entitlement pool (the --pool option). For example:
subscription-manager subscribe
--pool=ff8080812bc382e3012bc3845da100d2</p>

<p>As with the register command, the system can be
autosubscribed to the best-fitting subscriptions using the
--auto option: subscription-manager subscribe --auto</p>

<p>Some subscriptions define a count on the consumer, like
the number of sockets on the machine or the number of
virtual guests on a host. You can stack multiple
subscriptions together to cover the count. For exam- ple, if
there is a four socket server, you can use two subscriptions
for &quot;RHEL Server for Two Sockets&quot; to cover the
socket count. To specify the number of subscriptions to use,
use the --quantity option. For example: subscription-manager
subscribe --pool=ff8080812bc382e3012bc3845da100d2
--quantity=2</p>

<p>Unsubscribing a machine removes it from the product or
entitlement pool, which releases that entitlement
subscription it had consumed. The machine remains registered
with the entitlement service. Each product has an
identifying X.509 certificate installed with it. To
unsubscribe from a subscription for a specific product,
specify the serial number of the certificate:
subscription-manager unsubscribe
--serial=1128750306742160</p>

<p>Giving the unsubscribe command with the --all option
unsubscribes the machine from every subscription it has
consumed.</p>

<p>An option with registration, --autosubscribe , will
automatically sub- scribe the newly-registered system to the
entitlements pool which best matches the system architecture
and configuration. This option allows the system to be
subscribed as part of the registration process, rather than
separately managing subscriptions. subscription-manager
register --username=admin --password=secret
--autosubscribe</p>

<p>REDEEMING EXISTING SUBSCRIPTIONS Sometimes, a machine
may come pre-configured with products and sub- scriptions.
Rather than subscribing to a pool and claiming a
subscription, this system simply needs to redeem its
existing subscrip- tions.</p>

<p>After registration, subscriptions on pre-configured
machines can be claimed using the redeem command, which
essentially autosubscribes the system to its pre-existing
subscriptions. subscription-manager redeem
--email=admin@example.com --org=&quot;IT Dept&quot;</p>

<p>VIEWING LOCAL SUBSCRIPTION &amp; CONTENT PROVIDER
INFORMATION Red Hat has a hosted environment, through the
Customer Portal, that provides centralized access to
subscription management and content repositories. However,
organizations can use other tools -- like Katello -- for
content hosting and subscription management. With a local
content provider, the organization, environments,
repositories, and other structural configuration is
performed in the content provider. Red Hat Subscription
Manager can be used to display this information, using the
environments, orgs, and repos commands.</p>

<p>subscription-manager repos --list</p>

<p>subscription-manager environments --username=jsmith
--password=secret --org=prod</p>

<p>subscription-manager orgs --username=jsmith
--password=secret</p>

<p>UPDATING FACTS The information about a system, such as
its hardware and CPU, its oper- ating system versions, and
memory, are collected by Subscription Man- ager in a list of
facts. Subscription Manager uses these facts to determine
what purchased entitlements are compatible with the system.
Whenever these facts changes (such as installing an
additional CPU), the facts can be updated immediately using
the facts command.</p>

<p>subscription-manager facts --update</p>

<p>The collected facts can also be overridden by creating a
JSON file in the /etc/rhsm/facts/ directory. These have
simple formats that define a fact and value:
{&quot;fact1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;,&quot;fact2&quot;:
&quot;value2&quot;}</p>

<p>Any fact override file must have a .facts extension.</p>

<p>When these fact files are added, running the facts
command will update the collected facts with the new, manual
facts or values.</p>

<p>ENTITLEMENTS AND KICKSTART The subscription-manager tool
can be run as a post-install script as part of the kickstart
installation process. This allows entitlement management
(registration and subscription) to be automated along with
installation. For example: %post --log=/root/ks-post.log
/usr/sbin/subscription-manager register --username admin
--password secret --org east colo --autosubscribe
--force</p>

<p>GETTING INFORMATION FROM CERTIFICATES Both Subscription
Manager and product information is contained in X.509
certificates. To obtain this information, use tools like
openssl or pk12util to pretty-print the certificate
information. For example: openssl x509 -text -in
/etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem</p>
