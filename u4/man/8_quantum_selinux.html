<p>quantum_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
quantum quantum_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME quantum_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the quantum pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the quantum
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The quantum processes execute with the quantum_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep quantum_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The quantum_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,quantum_exec_t,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the quantum_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/quantum-server,
/usr/bin/quantum-ryu-agent,
/usr/bin/quantum-openvswitch-agent,
/usr/bin/quantum-linuxbridge-agent, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux quantum policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their quantum processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for quantum:</p>

<p>quantum_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a quantum_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type quantum_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux quantum policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their quantum processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for quantum:</p>

<p>quantum_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the quantum_t domain.</p>

<p>quantum_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the quantum_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>quantum_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as quantum log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>quantum_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_tmp_t type, if you want to
store quantum temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>quantum_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the quantum files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>quantum_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quantum_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the quantum files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux quantum policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their quantum processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for quantum:</p>

<p>quantum_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 9696</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type quantum_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
