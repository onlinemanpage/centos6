<p>Name java - the Java application launcher</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS java [ options ] class [ argument ... ] java [
options ] -jar file.jar [ argument ... ]</p>

<p>options Command-line options.</p>

<p>class Name of the class to be invoked.</p>

<p>file.jar Name of the jar file to be invoked. Used only
with -jar.</p>

<p>argument Argument passed to the main function.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The java tool launches a Java application.
It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading
a specified class, and invoking that classs main method.</p>

<p>The method must be declared public and static, it must
not return any value, and it must accept a String array as a
parameter. The method declaration must look like the
following:</p>

<p>public static void main(String args[])</p>

<p>By default, the first non-option argument is the name of
the class to be invoked. A fully-qualified class name should
be used. If the -jar option is specified, the first
non-option argument is the name of a JAR archive containing
class and resource files for the application, with the
startup class indicated by the Main-Class manifest
header.</p>

<p>The Java runtime searches for the startup class, and
other classes used, in three sets of locations: the
bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user
class path.</p>

<p>Non-option arguments after the class name or JAR file
name are passed to the main function.</p>

<p>OPTIONS The launcher has a set of standard options that
are supported on the current runtime environment and will be
supported in future releases. In addition, the current
implementations of the virtual machines sup- port a set of
non-standard options that are subject to change in future
releases.</p>

<p>Standard Options -client Select the Java HotSpot Client
VM. A 64-bit capable jdk currently ignores this option and
instead uses the Java Hotspot Server VM. For default VM
selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-server Select the Java HotSpot Server VM. On a 64-bit
capable jdk only the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported so
the -server option is implicit. For default VM selection,
see Server-Class Machine Detection @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/server-class.html</p>

<p>-agentlib:libname[=options] Load native agent library
libname, e.g. -agentlib:hprof -agentlib:jdwp=help
-agentlib:hprof=help For more information, see JVMTI Agent
Command Line Options @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/plat-
form/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting.</p>

<p>-agentpath:pathname[=options] Load a native agent
library by full pathname. For more informa- tion, see JVMTI
Agent Command Line Options @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/plat-
form/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting.</p>

<p>-classpath classpath</p>

<p>-cp classpath Specify a list of directories, JAR
archives, and ZIP archives to search for class files. Class
path entries are separated by colons (:). Specifying
-classpath or -cp overrides any setting of the CLASSPATH
environment variable. If -classpath and -cp are not used and
CLASSPATH is not set, the user class path consists of the
current directory (.). As a special convenience, a class
path element containing a base- name of * is considered
equivalent to specifying a list of all the files in the
directory with the extension .jar or .JAR (a java program
cannot tell the difference between the two invoca- tions).
For example, if directory foo contains a.jar and b.JAR, then
the class path element foo/* is expanded to a A.jar:b.JAR,
except that the order of jar files is unspecified. All jar
files in the specified directory, even hidden ones, are
included in the list. A classpath entry consisting simply of
* expands to a list of all the jar files in the current
directory. The CLASSPATH environment variable, where
defined, will be similarly expanded. Any class- path
wildcard expansion occurs before the Java virtual machine is
started -- no Java program will ever see unexpanded
wildcards except by querying the environment. For example;
by invoking Sys- tem.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;). For more
information on class paths, see Setting the Class Path @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/tools/index.html#classpath.</p>

<p>-Dproperty=value Set a system property value.</p>

<p>-d32</p>

<p>-d64 Request that the program to be run in a 32-bit or
64-bit environ- ment, respectively. If the requested
environment is not installed or is not supported, an error
is reported. Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM
supports 64-bit opera- tion, and the &quot;-server&quot;
option is implicit with the use of -d64. And the
&quot;-client&quot; option is ignored with the use of -d64.
This is subject to change in a future release. If neither
-d32 nor -d64 is specified, the default is to run in a
32-bit environment, except for 64-bit only systems. This is
sub- ject to change in a future release.</p>

<p>-enableassertions[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; |
:&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p>-ea[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class
name&gt; ]</p>

<p>-disableassertions[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot;
| :&lt;class name&gt; ]</p>

<p>-da[:&lt;package name&gt;&quot;...&quot; | :&lt;class
name&gt; ] Disable assertions. This is the default. With no
arguments, disableassertions or -da disables assertions.
With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the switch
disables assertions in the specified package and any
subpackages. If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the
switch disables assertions in the unnamed pack- age in the
current working directory. With one argument not end- ing in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch disables assertions in the
specified class. To run a program with assertions enabled in
package com.wom- bat.fruitbat but disabled in class
com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, the following command could be
used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat...
-da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -disableassertions and -da switches apply to all
class load- ers and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable
asserts in all system classes; see -disablesystemassertions
below. Enable assertions. Assertions are disabled by
default. With no arguments, enableassertions or -ea enables
assertions. With one argument ending in &quot;...&quot;, the
switch enables assertions in the specified package and any
subpackages. If the argument is simply &quot;...&quot;, the
switch enables assertions in the unnamed pack- age in the
current working directory. With one argument not end- ing in
&quot;...&quot;, the switch enables assertions in the
specified class. If a single command line contains multiple
instances of these switches, they are processed in order
before loading any classes. So, for example, to run a
program with assertions enabled only in package
com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages), the following
command could be used:</p>

<p>java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... &lt;Main Class&gt;</p>

<p>The -enableassertions and -ea switches apply to all
class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a
class loader). There is one exception to this rule: in their
no-argument form, the switches do not apply to system. This
makes it easy to turn on asserts in all classes except for
system classes. A separate switch is provided to enable
asserts in all system classes; see -enablesystemassertions
below.</p>

<p>-enablesystemassertions</p>

<p>-esa Enable asserts in all system classes (sets the
default assertion status for system classes to true).</p>

<p>-disablesystemassertions</p>

<p>-dsa Disables asserts in all system classes.</p>

<p>-help or -? Display usage information and exit.</p>

<p>-jar Execute a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The
first argument is the name of a JAR file instead of a
startup class name. In order for this option to work, the
manifest of the JAR file must contain a line of the form
Main-Class: classname. Here, classname identifies the class
having the pub- lic static void main(String[] args) method
that serves as your applications starting point. See the
jar(1) and the Jar trail of the Java Tutorial @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar for
infor- mation about working with Jar files and Jar-file
manifests. When you use this option, the JAR file is the
source of all user classes, and other user class path
settings are ignored. Note that JAR files that can be run
with the &quot;java -jar&quot; option can have their execute
permissions set so they can be run without using &quot;java
-jar&quot;. Refer to Java Archive (JAR) Files @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/jar/index.html.</p>

<p>-javaagent:jarpath[=options] Load a Java programming
language agent, see java.lang.instrument @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instru-
ment/package-summary.html.</p>

<p>-jre-restrict-search Include user-private JREs in the
version search.</p>

<p>-no-jre-restrict-search Exclude user-private JREs in the
version search.</p>

<p>-showversion Display version information and continue.
(See also -version.)</p>

<p>-splash:imagepath Show splash screen with image
specified by imagepath.</p>

<p>-verbose</p>

<p>-verbose:class Display information about each class
loaded.</p>

<p>-verbose:gc Report on each garbage collection event.</p>

<p>-verbose:jni Report information about use of native
methods and other Java Native Interface activity.</p>

<p>-version Display version information and exit. (See also
-showversion.)</p>

<p>-version:release Specifies that the version specified by
release is required by the class or jar file specified on
the command line. If the ver- sion of the java command
invoked does not meet this specification and an appropriate
implementation is found on the system, the appropriate
implementation will be used. release not only can specify an
exact version, but can also spec- ify a list of versions
called a version string. A version string is an ordered list
of version ranges separated by spaces. A ver- sion range is
either a version-id, a version-id followed by a star (*), a
version-id followed by a plus sign (+) , or two ver-
sion-ranges combined using an ampersand (&amp;). The star
means pre- fix match, the plus sign means this version or
greater, and the ampersand means the logical anding of the
two version-ranges. For example:</p>

<p>-version:&quot;1.6.0_13 1.6*&amp;1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p>The meaning of the above is that the class or jar file
requires either version 1.6.0_13, or a version with 1.6 as a
version-id prefix and that is not less than 1.6.0_10.. The
exact syntax and definition of version strings may be found
in Appendix A of the Java Network Launching Protocol &amp;
API Specification (JSR-56). For jar files, the usual
preference is to specify version requirements in the jar
file manifest rather than on the command line. See the
following NOTES section for important policy information on
the use of this option.</p>

<p>Non-Standard Options -X Display information about
non-standard options and exit.</p>

<p>-Xint Operate in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to
native code is disabled, and all bytecodes are executed by
the interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the
Java HotSpot VMs adaptive compiler will not be present in
this mode.</p>

<p>-Xbatch Disable background compilation. Normally the VM
will compile the method as a background task, running the
method in interpreter mode until the background compilation
is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables background
compilation so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a
foreground task until completed.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath:bootclasspath Specify a colon-separated
list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to
search for boot class files. These are used in place of the
boot class files included in the Java platform JDK. Note:
Applications that use this option for the purpose of over-
riding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing so
would contravene the Java Runtime Environment binary code
license.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/a:path Specify a colon-separated path of
directires, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to append to the
default bootstrap class path.</p>

<p>-Xbootclasspath/p:path Specify a colon-separated path of
directires, JAR archives, and ZIP archives to prepend in
front of the default bootstrap class path. Note:
Applications that use this option for the purpose of
overriding a class in rt.jar should not be deployed as doing
so would contravene the Java Runtime Environment binary code
license.</p>

<p>-Xcheck:jni Perform additional checks for Java Native
Interface (JNI) func- tions. Specifically, the Java Virtual
Machine validates the parameters passed to the JNI function
as well as the runtime environment data before processing
the JNI request. Any invalid data encountered indicates a
problem in the native code, and the Java Virtual Machine
will terminate with a fatal error in such cases. Expect a
performance degradation when this option is used.</p>

<p>-Xfuture Perform strict class-file format checks. For
purposes of back- wards compatibility, the default format
checks performed by the JDKs virtual machine are no stricter
than the checks performed by 1.1.x versions of the JDK
software. The -Xfuture flag turns on stricter class-file
format checks that enforce closer conformance to the
class-file format specification. Developers are encouraged
to use this flag when developing new code because the
stricter checks will become the default in future releases
of the Java application launcher.</p>

<p>-Xnoclassgc Disable class garbage collection. Use of
this option will prevent memory recovery from loaded classes
thus increasing overall memory usage. This could cause
OutOfMemoryError to be thrown in some applications.</p>

<p>-Xincgc Enable the incremental garbage collector. The
incremental garbage collector, which is off by default, will
reduce the occasional long garbage-collection pauses during
program execution. The incremental garbage collector will at
times execute concurrently with the program and during such
times will reduce the processor capacity available to the
program.</p>

<p>-Xloggc:file Report on each garbage collection event, as
with -verbose:gc, but log this data to file. In addition to
the information -verbose:gc gives, each reported event will
be preceeded by the time (in sec- onds) since the first
garbage-collection event. Always use a local file system for
storage of this file to avoid stalling the JVM due to
network latency. The file may be trun- cated in the case of
a full file system and logging will continue on the
truncated file. This option overrides -verbose:gc if both
are given on the command line.</p>

<p>-Xmnsize or -XX:NewSize Sets the size of the young
generation (nursery).</p>

<p>-Xmsn Specify the initial size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024
greater than 1MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate
kilobytes, or m or M to indicate megabytes. The default
value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration.
For more information, see HotSpot Ergonomics @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html Examples:</p>

<p>-Xms6291456 -Xms6144k -Xms6m</p>

<p>-Xmxn Specify the maximum size, in bytes, of the memory
allocation pool. This value must a multiple of 1024 greater
than 2MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, or
m or M to indicate megabytes. The default value is chosen at
runtime based on system configuration. For more information,
see HotSpot Ergonomics @
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/tech-
notes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html Examples:</p>

<p>-Xmx83886080 -Xmx81920k -Xmx80m</p>

<p>On Solaris 7 and Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper
limit for this value is approximately 4000m minus overhead
amounts. On Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit
is approximately 2000m minus overhead amounts. On Linux
platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2000m minus
overhead amounts.</p>

<p>-Xprof Profiles the running program, and sends profiling
data to stan- dard output. This option is provided as a
utility that is useful in program development and is not
intended to be used in produc- tion systems.</p>

<p>-Xrs Reduces use of operating-system signals by the Java
virtual machine (JVM). In a previous release, the Shutdown
Hooks facility was added to allow orderly shutdown of a Java
application. The intent was to allow user cleanup code (such
as closing database connections) to run at shutdown, even if
the JVM terminates abruptly. Suns JVM catches signals to
implement shutdown hooks for abnor- mal JVM termination. The
JVM uses SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the running
of shutdown hooks. The JVM uses a similar mechanism to
implement the pre-1.2 feature of dumping thread stacks for
debugging purposes. Sun s JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread
dumps. Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to
trap signals like SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead to
interference with the JVMs own signal handlers. The -Xrs
command-line option is avail- able to address this issue.
When -Xrs is used on Sun s JVM, the signal masks for SIGINT,
SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the JVM, and
signal handlers for these signals are not installed. There
are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:</p>

<p>o SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.</p>

<p>o User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to
run, for example by calling System.exit() when the JVM is to
be termi- nated.</p>

<p>-Xssn Set thread stack size.</p>

<p>-XX:AllocationPrefetchStyle=n Sets the style of prefetch
used during allocation. default=2.</p>

<p>-XX:+AggressiveOpts Enables aggressive optimization.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-DisableAttachMechanism This option specifies
whether tools (such as jmap and jconsole) are allowed to
attach to the JVM. By default, this feature is disabled.
That is, attaching is enabled. Example usage:</p>

<p>java -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism</p>

<p>-XXLargePageSizeInBytes=n This option specifies the
maximum size for large pages.</p>

<p>-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n Sets a target for the maximum GC
pause time. This is a soft goal, and the JVM will make its
best effort to achieve it.</p>

<p>-XX:NewSize Sets the size of the young generation
(nursery). Sames as -Xmn- size.</p>

<p>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=n Sets the number of GC threads in
the parallel collectors.</p>

<p>-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=n This option requires that
the UnlockExperimentalVMOptions flag be set first. Use the
PredictedClassLoadCount flag if your applica- tion loads a
lot of classes, and especially if class.forName() is used
heavily. The recommended value is the number of classes
loaded as shown in the output from -verbose:class. Example
usage:</p>

<p>java -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions
-XX:PredictedClassLoadCount=60013</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintCompilation Prints verbose output from the
HotSpot dynamic runtime compiler.</p>

<p>-XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps Prints
garbage collection output along with time stamps.</p>

<p>-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=0 This flag enables
aggressive processing of software references. Use this flag
if HotSpot GC is impacted by the software reference
count.</p>

<p>-XX:TLABSize=n Thread local allocation buffers (TLAB)
are enabled by default in HotSpot. HotSpot automatically
sizes TLABs based on allocation patterns. The -XX:TLABSize
option allows fine-tuning the size of TLABs.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseAltSigs The VM uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 by
default, which can sometimes conflict with applications that
signal-chain SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The -XX:+UseAltSigs option
will cause the VM to use signals other than SIGUSR1 and
SIGUSR2 as the default.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-UseCompressedOops Enables compressed references
in 64-bit JVMs. This option is true by default.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC or -XX:+UseG1GC These flags
enable either the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) or the G1
garbage collectors.</p>

<p>-XX:+|-UseLargePages Use this flag to enable large page
support. Large pages are enabled by default on Solaris.</p>

<p>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC Enables the parallel garbage
collectors, which are optimized for throughput and average
response time.</p>

<p>NOTES The -version:release command line option places no
restrictions on the complexity of the release specification.
However, only a restricted subset of the possible release
specifications represent sound policy and only these are
fully supported. These policies are:</p>

<p>1. Any version, represented by not using this
option.</p>

<p>2. Any version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id. For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&quot;</p>

<p>This would utilize any version greater than 1.6.0_10.
This is useful for a case where an interface was introduced
(or a bug fixed) in the release specified.</p>

<p>3. A version greater than an arbitrarily precise
version-id, bounded by the upper bound of that release
family. For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6*&quot;</p>

<p>4. &quot;Or&quot; expressions of items 2. or 3. above.
For example:</p>

<p>&quot;1.6.0_10+&amp;1.6* 1.7+&quot;</p>

<p>Similar to item 2. this is useful when a change was
introduced in a release (1.7) but also made available in
updates to previous releases.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS The following exit values are generally
returned by the launcher, typi- cally when the launcher is
called with the wrong arguments, serious errors, or
exceptions thrown from the Java Virtual Machine. However, a
Java application may choose to return any value using the
API call Sys- tem.exit(exitValue).</p>

<p>o 0: Successful completion</p>

<p>o &gt;0: An error occurred</p>
