<p>samba_selinux(8) samba SELinux Policy documentation
samba_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME samba_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the samba processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures samba ( SMB and CIFS
client/server programs for UNIX and name Service Switch
daemon for resolving names from Windows NT servers. )
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. samba policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run samba with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to act as the domain
controller, add users, groups and change passwords, you must
turn on the samba_domain_con- troller boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_domain_controller 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to share any file/directory
read only, you must turn on the samba_export_all_ro
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_export_all_ro 1</p>

<p>If you want to support SAMBA home directorie, you must
turn on the use_samba_home_dirs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_samba_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to create new home
directories (e.g. via PAM, you must turn on the
samba_create_home_dirs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_create_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to share users home
directories, you must turn on the samba_enable_home_dirs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to export ntfs/fusefs
volumes, you must turn on the samba_share_fusefs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_share_fusefs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to export NFS volumes, you
must turn on the samba_share_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_share_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to run unconfined script, you
must turn on the samba_run_unconfined boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_run_unconfined 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage
cifs file, you must turn on the sanlock_use_samba
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to share any file/directory
read/write, you must turn on the samba_export_all_rw
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_export_all_rw 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to manage cifs file, you must
turn on the virt_use_samba boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_samba 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux samba policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their samba processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for samba:</p>

<p>samba_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_etc_t type, if you want to
store samba files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>samba_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the samba_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb, /etc/rc.d/init.d/nmb,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/win- bind</p>

<p>samba_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as samba log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>samba_net_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_net_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the samba_net_t domain.</p>

<p>samba_net_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_net_tmp_t type, if you want
to store samba net temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>samba_secrets_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_secrets_t type, if you want
to treat the files as samba secrets data.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/samba/secrets.tdb, /etc/samba/passdb.tdb,
/etc/samba/MACHINE.SID, /etc/samba/smbpasswd</p>

<p>samba_share_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_share_t type, if you want to
treat the files as samba share data.</p>

<p>samba_unconfined_script_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_unconfined_script_exec_t
type, if you want to transition an executable to the
samba_unconfined_script_t domain.</p>

<p>samba_var_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the samba_var_t type, if you want to
store the s files under the /var directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/samba(/.*)?, /var/lib/samba(/.*)?,
/var/spool/samba(/.*)?</p>

<p>sambagui_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sambagui_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the sambagui_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux samba policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their samba pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for samba:</p>

<p>samba_net_t, samba_unconfined_net_t,
samba_unconfined_script_t, sam- bagui_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
