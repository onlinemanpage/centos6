<p>xend_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for xend
xend_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME xend_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the xend processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the xend
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The xend processes execute with the xend_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep xend_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The xend_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type,xend_exec_t&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the xend_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/usr/sbin/xend</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux xend policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their xend pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for xend:</p>

<p>xend_t, xenstored_t, xenconsoled_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a xend_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type xend_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. xend policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run xend with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow xen to manage nfs files, you must
turn on the xen_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xen_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow xen to manage nfs files, you must
turn on the xen_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xen_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux xend policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xend processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for xend:</p>

<p>xend_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xend_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the xend_t domain.</p>

<p>xend_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xend_tmp_t type, if you want to
store xend tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>xend_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xend_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the xend files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>xend_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xend_var_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as xend var log data, usually stored under
the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>xend_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xend_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the xend files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux xend policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xend processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for xend:</p>

<p>xen_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8002</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type xend_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
