<p>nsplugin_selinux(8) nsplugin SELinux Policy
documentation nsplugin_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME nsplugin_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the nsplugin pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures nsplugin (policy for
nsplugin) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. nsplu- gin policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run nsplugin with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to transition to confined nsplugin domains
from unconfined use, you must turn on the
allow_unconfined_nsplugin_transition boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_unconfined_nsplugin_transition 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow nsplugin code to connect to
unreserved port, you must turn on the nsplugin_can_network
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nsplugin_can_network 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow nsplugin code to execmem/execstac,
you must turn on the allow_nsplugin_execmem boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_nsplugin_execmem 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux nsplugin policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their nsplugin processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for nsplugin:</p>

<p>nsplugin_config_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nsplugin_config_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the nsplugin_config_t
domain.</p>

<p>nsplugin_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nsplugin_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the nsplugin_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/nspluginscan,
/usr/lib(64)?/nspluginwrapper/npviewer.bin,
/usr/bin/nspluginviewer</p>

<p>nsplugin_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nsplugin_home_t type, if you want
to store nsplu- gin files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>nsplugin_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nsplugin_rw_t type, if you want to
treat the files as nsplugin read/write content.</p>

<p>nsplugin_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nsplugin_tmp_t type, if you want to
store nsplugin temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux nsplugin policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their nsplugin processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
nsplugin:</p>

<p>nsplugin_t, nsplugin_config_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
