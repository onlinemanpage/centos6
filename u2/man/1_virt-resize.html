<p>virt-resize(1) Virtualization Support virt-resize(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-resize - Resize a virtual machine disk</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-resize [--resize
/dev/sdaN=[+/-]&lt;size&gt;[%]] [--expand /dev/sdaN]
[--shrink /dev/sdaN] [--ignore /dev/sdaN] [--delete
/dev/sdaN] [...] indisk outdisk</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Virt-resize is a tool which can resize a
virtual machine disk, making it larger or smaller overall,
and resizing or deleting any partitions contained
within.</p>

<p>Virt-resize cannot resize disk images in-place.
Virt-resize should not be used on live virtual machines -
for consistent results, shut the virtual machine down before
resizing it.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the associated tools:
virt-filesystems(1) and virt-df(1), we recommend you go and
read those manual pages first.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Copy &quot;olddisk&quot; to
&quot;newdisk&quot;, extending one of the guests partitions
to fill the extra 5GB of space.</p>

<p>truncate -r olddisk newdisk; truncate -s +5G newdisk
virt-filesystems --long -h --all -a olddisk # Note
&quot;/dev/sda2&quot; is a partition inside the
&quot;olddisk&quot; file. virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2
olddisk newdisk</p>

<p>As above, but make the /boot partition 200MB bigger,
while giving the remaining space to /dev/sda2:</p>

<p>virt-resize --resize /dev/sda1=+200M --expand /dev/sda2
olddisk newdisk</p>

<p>As above, but the output format will be uncompressed
qcow2:</p>

<p>qemu-img create -f qcow2 newdisk.qcow2 15G virt-resize
--expand /dev/sda2 olddisk newdisk.qcow2</p>

<p>DETAILED USAGE EXPANDING A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK 1. Shut
down the virtual machine 2. Locate input disk image Locate
the input disk image (ie. the file or device on the host
containing the guests disk). If the guest is managed by
libvirt, you can use &quot;virsh dumpxml&quot; like this to
find the disk image name:</p>

<p># virsh dumpxml guestname | xpath
/domain/devices/disk/source Found 1 nodes: -- NODE --
&lt;source dev=&quot;/dev/vg/lv_guest&quot; /&gt;</p>

<p>3. Look at current sizing Use virt-filesystems(1) to
display the current partitions and sizes:</p>

<p># virt-filesystems --long --parts --blkdevs -h -a
/dev/vg/lv_guest Name Type Size Parent /dev/sda1 partition
101M /dev/sda /dev/sda2 partition 7.9G /dev/sda /dev/sda
device 8.0G -</p>

<p>(This example is a virtual machine with an 8 GB disk
which we would like to expand up to 10 GB).</p>

<p>4. Create output disk Virt-resize cannot do in-place
disk modifications. You have to have space to store the
resized output disk.</p>

<p>To store the resized disk image in a file, create a file
of a suitable size:</p>

<p># rm -f outdisk # truncate -s 10G outdisk</p>

<p>Or use lvcreate(1) to create a logical volume:</p>

<p># lvcreate -L 10G -n lv_name vg_name</p>

<p>Or use virsh(1) vol-create-as to create a libvirt
storage volume:</p>

<p># virsh pool-list # virsh vol-create-as poolname newvol
10G</p>

<p>5. Resize virt-resize takes two mandatory parameters,
the input disk (eg. device or file) and the output disk. The
output disk is the one created in the previous step.</p>

<p># virt-resize indisk outdisk</p>

<p>This command just copies disk image &quot;indisk&quot;
to disk image &quot;outdisk&quot; without resizing or
changing any existing partitions. If &quot;outdisk&quot; is
larger, then an extra, empty partition is created at the end
of the disk covering the extra space. If &quot;outdisk&quot;
is smaller, then it will give an error.</p>

<p>More realistically you d want to expand existing
partitions in the disk image by passing extra options (for
the full list see the &quot;OPTIONS&quot; section
below).</p>

<p>&quot;--expand&quot; is the most useful option. It
expands the named partition within the disk to fill any
extra space:</p>

<p># virt-resize --expand /dev/sda2 indisk outdisk</p>

<p>(In this case, an extra partition is not created at the
end of the disk, because there will be no unused space).</p>

<p>&quot;--resize&quot; is the other commonly used option.
The following would increase the size of /dev/sda1 by 200M,
and expand /dev/sda2 to fill the rest of the available
space:</p>

<p># virt-resize --resize /dev/sda1=+200M --expand
/dev/sda2 indisk outdisk</p>

<p>If the expanded partition in the image contains a
filesystem or LVM PV, then if virt-resize knows how, it will
resize the contents, the equivalent of calling a command
such as pvresize(8), resize2fs(8) or ntfsresize(8). However
virt-resize does not know how to resize some filesystems, so
you would have to online resize them after booting the
guest.</p>

<p>Other options are covered below.</p>

<p>6. Test Thoroughly test the new disk image before
discarding the old one.</p>

<p>If you are using libvirt, edit the XML to point at the
new disk:</p>

<p># virsh edit guestname</p>

<p>Change &lt;source ...&gt;, see
&lt;http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDisks&gt;</p>

<p>Then start up the domain with the new, resized disk:</p>

<p># virsh start guestname</p>

<p>and check that it still works. See also the
&quot;NOTES&quot; section below for additional
information.</p>

<p>7. Resize LVs etc inside the guest (This can also be
done offline using guestfish(1))</p>

<p>Once the guest has booted you should see the new space
available, at least for filesystems that virt-resize knows
how to resize, and for PVs. The user may need to resize LVs
inside PVs, and also resize filesystem types that
virt-resize does not know how to expand.</p>

<p>SHRINKING A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK Shrinking is somewhat
more complex than expanding, and only an overview is given
here.</p>

<p>Firstly virt-resize will not attempt to shrink any
partition content (PVs, filesystems). The user has to shrink
content before passing the disk image to virt-resize, and
virt-resize will check that the content has been shrunk
properly.</p>

<p>(Shrinking can also be done offline using
guestfish(1))</p>

<p>After shrinking PVs and filesystems, shut down the
guest, and proceed with steps 3 and 4 above to allocate a
new disk image.</p>

<p>Then run virt-resize with any of the
&quot;--shrink&quot; and/or &quot;--resize&quot;
options.</p>

<p>IGNORING OR DELETING PARTITIONS virt-resize also gives a
convenient way to ignore or delete partitions when copying
from the input disk to the output disk. Ignoring a partition
speeds up the copy where you dont care about the existing
contents of a partition. Deleting a partition removes it
completely, but note that it also renumbers any partitions
after the one which is deleted, which can leave some guests
unbootable.</p>

<p>QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW FORMATS If the input disk is in
qcow2 format, then you may prefer that the output is in
qcow2 format as well. Alternately, virt-resize can convert
the format on the fly. The output format is simply
determined by the format of the empty output container that
you provide. Thus to create qcow2 output, use:</p>

<p>qemu-img create [-c] -f qcow2 outdisk [size]</p>

<p>instead of the truncate command (use &quot;-c&quot; for
a compressed disk).</p>

<p>Similarly, to get non-sparse raw output use:</p>

<p>fallocate -l size outdisk</p>

<p>(on older systems that dont have the fallocate(1)
command use &quot;dd if=/dev/zero of=outdisk bs=1M
count=..&quot;)</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>--resize part=size Resize the named partition (expanding
or shrinking it) so that it has the given size.</p>

<p>&quot;size&quot; can be expressed as an absolute number
followed by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes, Kilobytes,
Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or Exabytes; or
as a percentage of the current size; or as a relative number
or percentage. For example:</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda2=10G</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda4=90%</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda2=+1G</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda2=-200M</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda1=+128K</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda1=+10%</p>

<p>--resize /dev/sda1=-10%</p>

<p>You can increase the size of any partition. Virt-resize
will expand the direct content of the partition if it knows
how (see &quot;--expand&quot; below).</p>

<p>You can only decrease the size of partitions that
contain filesystems or PVs which have already been shrunk.
Virt-resize will check this has been done before proceeding,
or else will print an error (see also
&quot;--resize-force&quot;).</p>

<p>You can give this option multiple times.</p>

<p>--resize-force part=size This is the same as
&quot;--resize&quot; except that it will let you decrease
the size of any partition. Generally this means you will
lose any data which was at the end of the partition you
shrink, but you may not care about that (eg. if shrinking an
unused partition, or if you can easily recreate it such as a
swap partition).</p>

<p>See also the &quot;--ignore&quot; option.</p>

<p>--expand part Expand the named partition so it uses up
all extra space (space left over after any other resize
changes that you request have been done).</p>

<p>If virt-resize knows how, it will expand the direct
content of the partition. For example, if the partition is
an LVM PV, it will expand the PV to fit (like calling
pvresize(8)). Virt-resize leaves any other content it doesnt
know about alone.</p>

<p>Currently virt-resize can resize:</p>

<p>&middot; ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystems when they are
contained directly inside a partition.</p>

<p>&middot; NTFS filesystems contained directly in a
partition, if libguestfs was compiled with support for
NTFS.</p>

<p>The filesystem must have been shut down consistently
last time it was used. Additionally, ntfsresize(8) marks the
resized filesystem as requiring a consistency check, so at
the first boot after resizing Windows will check the
disk.</p>

<p>&middot; LVM PVs (physical volumes). virt-resize does
not usually resize anything inside the PV, but see the
&quot;--LV-expand&quot; option. The user could also resize
LVs as desired after boot.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot use &quot;--expand&quot; and
&quot;--shrink&quot; together.</p>

<p>--shrink part Shrink the named partition until the
overall disk image fits in the destination. The named
partition must contain a filesystem or PV which has already
been shrunk using another tool (eg. guestfish(1) or other
online tools). Virt-resize will check this and give an error
if it has not been done.</p>

<p>The amount by which the overall disk must be shrunk
(after carrying out all other operations requested by the
user) is called the &quot;deficit&quot;. For example, a
straight copy (assume no other operations) from a 5GB disk
image to a 4GB disk image results in a 1GB deficit. In this
case, virt-resize would give an error unless the user
specified a partition to shrink and that partition had more
than a gigabyte of free space.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot use &quot;--expand&quot; and
&quot;--shrink&quot; together.</p>

<p>--ignore part Ignore the named partition. Effectively
this means the partition is allocated on the destination
disk, but the content is not copied across from the source
disk. The content of the partition will be blank (all zero
bytes).</p>

<p>You can give this option multiple times.</p>

<p>--delete part Delete the named partition. It would be
more accurate to describe this as &quot;dont copy it
over&quot;, since virt-resize doesn t do in-place changes
and the original disk image is left intact.</p>

<p>Note that when you delete a partition, then anything
contained in the partition is also deleted. Furthermore,
this causes any partitions that come after to be renumbered,
which can easily make your guest unbootable.</p>

<p>You can give this option multiple times.</p>

<p>--LV-expand logvol This takes the logical volume and, as
a final step, expands it to fill all the space available in
its volume group. A typical usage, assuming a Linux guest
with a single PV &quot;/dev/sda2&quot; and a root device
called &quot;/dev/vg_guest/lv_root&quot; would be:</p>

<p>virt-resize indisk outdisk --expand /dev/sda2
--LV-expand /dev/vg_guest/lv_root</p>

<p>This would first expand the partition (and PV), and then
expand the root device to fill the extra space in the
PV.</p>

<p>The contents of the LV are also resized if virt-resize
knows how to do that. You can stop virt-resize from trying
to expand the content by using the option
&quot;--no-expand-content&quot;.</p>

<p>Use virt-filesystems(1) to list the filesystems in the
guest.</p>

<p>You can give this option multiple times, but it doesnt
make sense to do this unless the logical volumes you specify
are all in different volume groups.</p>

<p>--no-copy-boot-loader By default, virt-resize copies
over some sectors at the start of the disk (up to the
beginning of the first partition). Commonly these sectors
contain the Master Boot Record (MBR) and the boot loader,
and are required in order for the guest to boot
correctly.</p>

<p>If you specify this flag, then this initial copy is not
done. You may need to reinstall the boot loader in this
case.</p>

<p>--no-extra-partition By default, virt-resize creates an
extra partition if there is any extra, unused space after
all resizing has happened. Use this option to prevent the
extra partition from being created. If you do this then the
extra space will be inaccessible until you run fdisk,
parted, or some other partitioning tool in the guest.</p>

<p>Note that if the surplus space is smaller than 10 MB, no
extra partition will be created.</p>

<p>--no-expand-content By default, virt-resize will try to
expand the direct contents of partitions, if it knows how
(see &quot;--expand&quot; option above).</p>

<p>If you give the &quot;--no-expand-content&quot; option
then virt-resize will not attempt this.</p>

<p>-d | --debug Enable debugging messages.</p>

<p>-n | --dryrun Print a summary of what would be done, but
don t do anything.</p>

<p>-q | --quiet Dont print the summary.</p>

<p>--format raw Specify the format of the input disk image.
If this flag is not given then it is auto-detected from the
image itself.</p>

<p>If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images,
you should ensure the format is always specified.</p>

<p>Note that this option does not affect the output format.
See &quot;QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW FORMATS&quot;.</p>

<p>--output-format raw Specify the format of the output
disk image. If this flag is not given then it is
auto-detected from the image itself.</p>

<p>If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images,
you should ensure the format is always specified.</p>

<p>Note that you still need to create the output disk with
the right format. See &quot;QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW
FORMATS&quot;.</p>

<p>NOTES &quot;Partition 1 does not end on cylinder
boundary.&quot; Virt-resize aligns partitions to multiples
of 64 sectors. Usually this means the partitions will not be
aligned to the ancient CHS geometry. However CHS geometry is
meaningless for disks manufactured since the early 1990s,
and doubly so for virtual hard drives. Alignment of
partitions to cylinders is not required by any modern
operating system.</p>

<p>RESIZING WINDOWS VIRTUAL MACHINES In Windows Vista and
later versions, Microsoft switched to using a separate boot
partition. In these VMs, typically &quot;/dev/sda1&quot; is
the boot partition and &quot;/dev/sda2&quot; is the main
(C:) drive. We have not had any luck resizing the boot
partition. Doing so seems to break the guest completely.
However expanding the second partition (ie. C: drive) should
work.</p>

<p>Windows may initiate a lengthy &quot;chkdsk&quot; on
first boot after a resize, if NTFS partitions have been
expanded. This is just a safety check and (unless it find
errors) is nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>GUEST BOOT STUCK AT &quot;GRUB&quot; If a Linux guest
does not boot after resizing, and the boot is stuck after
printing &quot;GRUB&quot; on the console, try reinstalling
grub. This sometimes happens on older (RHEL 5-era) guests,
for reasons we dont fully understand, although we think is
to do with partition alignment.</p>

<p>guestfish -i -a newdisk &gt;&lt;fs&gt; cat
/boot/grub/device.map # check the contents of this file are
sensible or # edit the file if necessary &gt;&lt;fs&gt;
grub-install / /dev/vda &gt;&lt;fs&gt; exit</p>

<p>For more flexible guest reconfiguration, including if
you need to specify other parameters to grub-install, use
virt-rescue(1).</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE TOOLS There are several proprietary tools
for resizing partitions. We wont mention any here.</p>

<p>parted(8) and its graphical shell gparted can do some
types of resizing operations on disk images. They can resize
and move partitions, but I dont think they can do anything
with the contents, and they certainly dont understand
LVM.</p>

<p>guestfish(1) can do everything that virt-resize can do
and a lot more, but at a much lower level. You will probably
end up hand-calculating sector offsets, which is something
that virt-resize was designed to avoid. If you want to see
the guestfish-equivalent commands that virt- resize runs,
use the &quot;--debug&quot; flag.</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
