<p>PMDARSYSLOG(1) Performance Co-Pilot PMDARSYSLOG(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdarsyslog - rsyslog (reliable and extended
syslog) PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdarsyslog is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which exports metric values from the
rsyslogd(8) server. Further details about rsyslog can be
found at http://www.rsyslog.com/.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names and values
for the rsyslog performance metrics, do the following as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdarsyslog is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>In order to use this agent, rsyslog stats gathering must
be enabled. This is done by adding the lines:</p>

<p>$ModLoad impstats $PStatsInterval 5 # log every 5
seconds syslog.info |/var/log/pcp/rsyslog/stats</p>

<p>to your rsyslog.conf(5) configuration file after
installing the PMDA. Take care to ensure the syslog.info
messages do not get logged in any other file, as this could
unexpectedly fill your filesystem. Syntax useful for this is
syslog.!=info for explicitly excluding these.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/pcp/rsyslog/stats named pipe containing
statistics exported from rsyslog, usually created by the
PMDA Install script.</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/Install installation script for
the pmdarsyslog agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdarsyslog agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/rsyslog.log default log file for error
messages from pmdarsyslog</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1), rsyslog.conf(5), rsyslogd(8).</p>
