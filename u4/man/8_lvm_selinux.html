<p>lvm_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for lvm
lvm_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME lvm_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the lvm processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lvm
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The lvm processes execute with the lvm_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep lvm_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The lvm_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type,lvm_exec_t&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the lvm_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system, /lib/lvm-10/.*,
/lib/lvm-200/.*, /sbin/lvs, /sbin/vgs, /sbin/pvs, /sbin/lvm,
/sbin/vgck, /sbin/pvdata, /sbin/pvmove, /sbin/pvscan,
/sbin/lvscan, /sbin/kpartx, /sbin/lvmsar, /sbin/dmraid,
/sbin/vgscan, /sbin/vgmerge, /sbin/dmsetup, /sbin/e2fsadm,

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux lvm policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their lvm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for lvm:</p>

<p>lvm_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a lvm_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type lvm_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux lvm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lvm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for lvm:</p>

<p>lvm_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_etc_t type, if you want to
store lvm files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>lvm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the lvm_t domain.</p>

<p>lvm_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as lvm lock data, stored under the /var/lock
directory</p>

<p>lvm_metadata_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_metadata_t type, if you want to
treat the files as lvm metadata data.</p>

<p>lvm_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_tmp_t type, if you want to
store lvm temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>lvm_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the lvm files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>lvm_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lvm_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the lvm files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type lvm_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
