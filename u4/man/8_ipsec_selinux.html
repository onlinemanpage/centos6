<p>ipsec_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for ipsec
ipsec_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ipsec_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the ipsec processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ipsec
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The ipsec processes execute with the ipsec_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep ipsec_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The ipsec_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;ipsec_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the ipsec_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/lib(64)?/ipsec/spi, /usr/lib(64)?/ipsec/pluto,
/usr/lib(64)?/ipsec/eroute, /usr/lib(64)?/ipsec/klipsdebug,
/usr/local/lib(64)?/ipsec/spi,
/usr/local/lib(64)?/ipsec/pluto,
/usr/local/lib(64)?/ipsec/eroute,
/usr/local/lib(64)?/ipsec/klipsdebug,
/usr/libexec/ipsec/spi, /usr/libexec/ipsec/pluto,
/usr/libexec/ipsec/eroute, /usr/libexec/ipsec/klipsdebug</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their ipsec pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for ipsec:</p>

<p>ipsec_t, ipsec_mgmt_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a ipsec_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type ipsec_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ipsec:</p>

<p>ipsec_conf_file_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_conf_file_t type, if you want
to treat the files as ipsec conf content.</p>

<p>ipsec_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ipsec_t domain.</p>

<p>ipsec_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the ipsec_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>ipsec_key_file_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_key_file_t type, if you want
to treat the files as ipsec key content.</p>

<p>ipsec_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as ipsec log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>ipsec_mgmt_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the ipsec_mgmt_t domain.</p>

<p>ipsec_mgmt_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_lock_t type, if you want
to treat the files as ipsec mgmt lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the ipsec mgmt files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>ipsec_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_tmp_t type, if you want to
store ipsec tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>ipsec_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ipsec_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the ipsec files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for ipsec:</p>

<p>ipsecnat_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 4500 udp 4500</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type ipsec_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>ipsec_key_file_t</p>

<p>/etc/ipsec.d(/.*)? /etc/racoon/certs(/.*)?
/etc/ipsec.secrets /etc/racoon/psk.txt</p>

<p>ipsec_tmp_t</p>

<p>ipsec_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/racoon(/.*)? /var/run/pluto(/.*)?
/var/run/racoon.pid</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>net_conf_t</p>

<p>/etc/ntpd?.conf.* /etc/yp.conf.* /etc/denyhosts.*
/etc/hosts.deny.* /etc/resolv.conf.* /etc/ntp/step-tickers.*
/etc/sysconfig/networking(/.*)?
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts(/.*)?
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.*resolv.conf /etc/hosts
/etc/ethers</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>security_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
