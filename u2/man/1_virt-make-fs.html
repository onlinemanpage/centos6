<p>virt-make-fs(1) Virtualization Support
virt-make-fs(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-make-fs - Make a filesystem from a tar archive
or files</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-make-fs [--options] input.tar
output.img</p>

<p>virt-make-fs [--options] input.tar.gz output.img</p>

<p>virt-make-fs [--options] directory output.img</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Virt-make-fs is a command line tool for
creating a filesystem from a tar archive or some files in a
directory. It is similar to tools like mkisofs(1),
genisoimage(1) and mksquashfs(1). Unlike those tools, it can
create common filesystem types like ext2/3 or NTFS, which
can be useful if you want to attach these filesystems to
existing virtual machines (eg. to import large amounts of
read-only data to a VM).</p>

<p>Basic usage is:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs input output</p>

<p>where &quot;input&quot; is either a directory containing
files that you want to add, or a tar archive (either
uncompressed tar or gzip-compressed tar); and
&quot;output&quot; is a disk image. The input type is
detected automatically. The output disk image defaults to a
raw ext2 image unless you specify extra flags (see
&quot;OPTIONS&quot; below).</p>

<p>EXTRA SPACE Unlike formats such as tar and squashfs, a
filesystem does not &quot;just fit&quot; the files that it
contains, but might have extra space. Depending on how you
are going to use the output, you might think this extra
space is wasted and want to minimize it, or you might want
to leave space so that more files can be added later.
Virt-make-fs defaults to minimizing the extra space, but you
can use the &quot;--size&quot; flag to leave space in the
filesystem if you want it.</p>

<p>An alternative way to leave extra space but not make the
output image any bigger is to use an alternative disk image
format (instead of the default &quot;raw&quot; format).
Using &quot;--format=qcow2&quot; will use the native
QEmu/KVM qcow2 image format (check your hypervisor supports
this before using it). This allows you to choose a large
&quot;--size&quot; but the extra space won t actually be
allocated in the image until you try to store something in
it.</p>

<p>Dont forget that you can also use local commands
including resize2fs(8) and virt-resize(1) to resize existing
filesystems, or rerun virt-make-fs to build another image
from scratch.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --size=+200M input
output.img</p>

<p>FILESYSTEM TYPE The default filesystem type is
&quot;ext2&quot;. Just about any filesystem type that
libguestfs supports can be used (but not read-only formats
like ISO9660). Here are some of the more common choices:</p>

<p>ext3 Note that ext3 filesystems contain a journal,
typically 1-32 MB in size. If you are not going to use the
filesystem in a way that requires the journal, then this is
just wasted overhead.</p>

<p>ntfs or vfat Useful if exporting data to a Windows
guest.</p>

<p>Note for vfat: The tar archive or local directory must
only contain files which are owned by root (ie. UID:GID =
0:0). The reason is that the tar program running within
libguestfs is unable to change the ownership of non-root
files, since vfat itself does not support this.</p>

<p>minix Lower overhead than &quot;ext2&quot;, but certain
limitations on filename length and total filesystem
size.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --type=minix input minixfs.img</p>

<p>TO PARTITION OR NOT TO PARTITION Optionally virt-make-fs
can add a partition table to the output disk.</p>

<p>Adding a partition can make the disk image more
compatible with certain virtualized operating systems which
dont expect to see a filesystem directly located on a block
device (Linux doesnt care and will happily handle both
types).</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you have a partition table then
the output image is no longer a straight filesystem. For
example you cannot run fsck(8) directly on a partitioned
disk image. (However libguestfs tools such as guestfish(1)
and virt-resize(1) can still be used).</p>

<p>EXAMPLE</p>

<p>Add an MBR partition:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --partition -- input disk.img</p>

<p>If the output disk image could be terabyte-sized or
larger, its better to use an EFI/GPT-compatible partition
table:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --partition=gpt --size=+4T --format=qcow2
input disk.img</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>--version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>--debug Enable debugging information.</p>

<p>--size=&lt;N&gt; --size=+&lt;N&gt; -s &lt;N&gt; -s
+&lt;N&gt; Use the &quot;--size&quot; (or &quot;-s&quot;)
option to choose the size of the output image.</p>

<p>If this option is not given, then the output image will
be just large enough to contain all the files, with not much
wasted space.</p>

<p>To choose a fixed size output disk, specify an absolute
number followed by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes, Kilobytes,
Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or Exabytes. This
must be large enough to contain all the input files, else
you will get an error.</p>

<p>To leave extra space, specify &quot;+&quot; (plus sign)
and a number followed by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes,
Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or
Exabytes. For example: &quot;--size=+200M&quot; means enough
space for the input files, and (approximately) an extra 200
MB free space.</p>

<p>Note that virt-make-fs estimates free space, and
therefore will not produce filesystems containing precisely
the free space requested. (It is much more expensive and
time-consuming to produce a filesystem which has precisely
the desired free space).</p>

<p>--format=&lt;fmt&gt; -F &lt;fmt&gt; Choose the output
disk image format.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;raw&quot; (raw disk image).</p>

<p>For other choices, see the qemu-img(1) manpage. The only
other choice that would really make sense here is
&quot;qcow2&quot;.</p>

<p>--type=&lt;fs&gt; -t &lt;fs&gt; Choose the output
filesystem type.</p>

<p>The default is &quot;ext2&quot;.</p>

<p>Any filesystem which is supported read-write by
libguestfs can be used here.</p>

<p>--partition --partition=&lt;parttype&gt; If specified,
this flag adds an MBR partition table to the output disk
image.</p>

<p>You can change the partition table type, eg.
&quot;--partition=gpt&quot; for large disks.</p>

<p>Note that if you just use a lonesome
&quot;--partition&quot;, the Perl option parser might
consider the next parameter to be the partition type. For
example:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --partition input.tar ...</p>

<p>would cause virt-make-fs to think you wanted to use a
partition type of &quot;input.tar&quot; which is completely
wrong. To avoid this, use &quot;--&quot; (a double dash)
between options and the input file argument:</p>

<p>virt-make-fs --partition -- input.tar ...</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
