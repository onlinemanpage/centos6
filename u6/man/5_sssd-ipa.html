<p>SSSD-IPA(5) File Formats and Conventions SSSD-IPA(5)</p>

<p>NAME sssd-ipa - the configuration file for SSSD</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the configuration
of the IPA provider for sssd(8). For a detailed syntax
reference, refer to the FILE FORMAT section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>The IPA provider is a back end used to connect to an IPA
server. (Refer to the freeipa.org web site for information
about IPA servers.) This provider requires that the machine
be joined to the IPA domain; configuration is almost
entirely self-discovered and obtained directly from the
server.</p>

<p>The IPA provider accepts the same options used by the
sssd-ldap(5) identity provider and the sssd-krb5(5)
authentication provider with some exceptions described
below.</p>

<p>However, it is neither necessary nor recommended to set
these options. IPA provider can also be used as an access
and chpass provider. As an access provider it uses HBAC
(host-based access control) rules. Please refer to
freeipa.org for more information about HBAC. No
configuration of access provider is required on the client
side.</p>

<p>The IPA provider will use the PAC responder if the
Kerberos tickets of users from trusted realms contain a PAC.
To make configuration easier the PAC responder is started
automatically if the IPA ID provider is configured.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Refer to the section DOMAIN
SECTIONS of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.</p>

<p>ipa_domain (string) Specifies the name of the IPA
domain. This is optional. If not provided, the configuration
domain name is used.</p>

<p>ipa_server, ipa_backup_server (string) The
comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames of the IPA
servers to which SSSD should connect in the order of
preference. For more information on failover and server
redundancy, see the FAILOVER section. This is optional if
autodiscovery is enabled. For more information on service
discovery, refer to the SERVICE DISCOVERY section.</p>

<p>ipa_hostname (string) Optional. May be set on machines
where the hostname(5) does not reflect the fully qualified
name used in the IPA domain to identify this host.</p>

<p>dyndns_update (boolean) Optional. This option tells SSSD
to automatically update the DNS server built into FreeIPA v2
with the IP address of this client. The update is secured
using GSS-TSIG. The IP address of the IPA LDAP connection is
used for the updates, if it is not otherwise specified by
using the dyndns_iface option.</p>

<p>NOTE: On older systems (such as RHEL 5), for this
behavior to work reliably, the default Kerberos realm must
be set properly in /etc/krb5.conf</p>

<p>NOTE: While it is still possible to use the old
ipa_dyndns_update option, users should migrate to using
dyndns_update in their config file.</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>dyndns_ttl (integer) The TTL to apply to the client DNS
record when updating it. If dyndns_update is false this has
no effect. This will override the TTL serverside if set by
an administrator.</p>

<p>NOTE: While it is still possible to use the old
ipa_dyndns_ttl option, users should migrate to using
dyndns_ttl in their config file.</p>

<p>Default: 1200 (seconds)</p>

<p>dyndns_iface (string) Optional. Applicable only when
dyndns_update is true. Choose the interface whose IP address
should be used for dynamic DNS updates.</p>

<p>NOTE: While it is still possible to use the old
ipa_dyndns_iface option, users should migrate to using
dyndns_iface in their config file.</p>

<p>Default: Use the IP address of the IPA LDAP
connection</p>

<p>ipa_enable_dns_sites (boolean) Enables DNS sites -
location based service discovery.</p>

<p>If true and service discovery (see Service Discovery
paragraph at the bottom of the man page) is enabled, then
the SSSD will first attempt location based discovery using a
query that contains
&quot;_location.hostname.example.com&quot; and then fall
back to traditional SRV discovery. If the location based
discovery succeeds, the IPA servers located with the
location based discovery are treated as primary servers and
the IPA servers located using the traditional SRV discovery
are used as back up servers</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>dyndns_refresh_interval (integer) How often should the
back end perform periodic DNS update in addition to the
automatic update performed when the back end goes online.
This option is optional and applicable only when
dyndns_update is true.</p>

<p>Default: 0 (disabled)</p>

<p>dyndns_update_ptr (bool) Whether the PTR record should
also be explicitly updated when updating the client&acute;s
DNS records. Applicable only when dyndns_update is true.</p>

<p>This option should be False in most IPA deployments as
the IPA server generates the PTR records automatically when
forward records are changed.</p>

<p>Default: False (disabled)</p>

<p>dyndns_force_tcp (bool) Whether the nsupdate utility
should default to using TCP for communicating with the DNS
server.</p>

<p>Default: False (let nsupdate choose the protocol)</p>

<p>ipa_hbac_search_base (string) Optional. Use the given
string as search base for HBAC related objects.</p>

<p>Default: Use base DN</p>

<p>ipa_host_search_base (string) Optional. Use the given
string as search base for host objects.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>If filter is given in any of search bases and
ipa_hbac_support_srchost is set to False, the filter will be
ignored.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_search_base (string) Optional. Use the given
string as search base for SELinux user maps.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ipa_subdomains_search_base (string) Optional. Use the
given string as search base for trusted domains.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of cn=trusts,%basedn</p>

<p>ipa_master_domain_search_base (string) Optional. Use the
given string as search base for master domain object.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of cn=ad,cn=etc,%basedn</p>

<p>krb5_validate (boolean) Verify with the help of
krb5_keytab that the TGT obtained has not been spoofed.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>Note that this default differs from the traditional
Kerberos provider back end.</p>

<p>krb5_realm (string) The name of the Kerberos realm. This
is optional and defaults to the value of ipa_domain.</p>

<p>The name of the Kerberos realm has a special meaning in
IPA - it is converted into the base DN to use for performing
LDAP operations.</p>

<p>krb5_canonicalize (boolean) Specifies if the host and
user principal should be canonicalized when connecting to
IPA LDAP and also for AS requests. This feature is available
with MIT Kerberos &gt;= 1.7</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>krb5_use_fast (string) Enables flexible authentication
secure tunneling (FAST) for Kerberos pre-authentication. The
following options are supported:</p>

<p>never use FAST.</p>

<p>try to use FAST. If the server does not support FAST,
continue the authentication without it. This is equivalent
to not setting this option at all.</p>

<p>demand to use FAST. The authentication fails if the
server does not require fast.</p>

<p>Default: try</p>

<p>NOTE: SSSD supports FAST only with MIT Kerberos version
1.8 and later. If SSSD is used with an older version of MIT
Kerberos, using this option is a configuration error.</p>

<p>ipa_hbac_refresh (integer) The amount of time between
lookups of the HBAC rules against the IPA server. This will
reduce the latency and load on the IPA server if there are
many access-control requests made in a short period.</p>

<p>Default: 5 (seconds)</p>

<p>ipa_hbac_selinux (integer) The amount of time between
lookups of the SELinux maps against the IPA server. This
will reduce the latency and load on the IPA server if there
are many user login requests made in a short period.</p>

<p>Default: 5 (seconds)</p>

<p>ipa_hbac_treat_deny_as (string) This option specifies
how to treat the deprecated DENY-type HBAC rules. As of
FreeIPA v2.1, DENY rules are no longer supported on the
server. All users of FreeIPA will need to migrate their
rules to use only the ALLOW rules. The client will support
two modes of operation during this transition period:</p>

<p>DENY_ALL: If any HBAC DENY rules are detected, all users
will be denied access.</p>

<p>IGNORE: SSSD will ignore any DENY rules. Be very careful
with this option, as it may result in opening unintended
access.</p>

<p>Default: DENY_ALL</p>

<p>ipa_hbac_support_srchost (boolean) If this is set to
false, then srchost as given to SSSD by PAM will be
ignored.</p>

<p>Note that if set to False, this option casuses filters
given in ipa_host_search_base to be ignored;</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ipa_server_mode (boolean) This option should only be set
by the IPA installer.</p>

<p>The option denotes that the SSSD is running on IPA
server and should perform lookups of users and groups from
trusted domains differently.</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ipa_automount_location (string) The automounter location
this IPA client will be using</p>

<p>Default: The location named &quot;default&quot;</p>

<p>Please note that the automounter only reads the master
map on startup, so if any autofs-related changes are made to
the sssd.conf, you typically also need to restart the
automounter daemon after restarting the SSSD.</p>

<p>ipa_netgroup_member_of (string) The LDAP attribute that
lists netgroup&acute;s memberships.</p>

<p>Default: memberOf</p>

<p>ipa_netgroup_member_user (string) The LDAP attribute
that lists system users and groups that are direct members
of the netgroup.</p>

<p>Default: memberUser</p>

<p>ipa_netgroup_member_host (string) The LDAP attribute
that lists hosts and host groups that are direct members of
the netgroup.</p>

<p>Default: memberHost</p>

<p>ipa_netgroup_member_ext_host (string) The LDAP attribute
that lists FQDNs of hosts and host groups that are members
of the netgroup.</p>

<p>Default: externalHost</p>

<p>ipa_netgroup_domain (string) The LDAP attribute that
contains NIS domain name of the netgroup.</p>

<p>Default: nisDomainName</p>

<p>ipa_host_object_class (string) The object class of a
host entry in LDAP.</p>

<p>Default: ipaHost</p>

<p>ipa_host_fqdn (string) The LDAP attribute that contains
FQDN of the host.</p>

<p>Default: fqdn</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_object_class (string) The object
class of a host entry in LDAP.</p>

<p>Default: ipaHost</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_name (string) The LDAP attribute
that contains the name of SELinux usermap.</p>

<p>Default: cn</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_member_user (string) The LDAP
attribute that contains all users / groups this rule match
against.</p>

<p>Default: memberUser</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_member_host (string) The LDAP
attribute that contains all hosts / hostgroups this rule
match against.</p>

<p>Default: memberHost</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_see_also (string) The LDAP attribute
that contains DN of HBAC rule which can be used for matching
instead of memberUser and memberHost</p>

<p>Default: seeAlso</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_selinux_user (string) The LDAP
attribute that contains SELinux user string itself.</p>

<p>Default: ipaSELinuxUser</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_enabled (string) The LDAP attribute
that contains whether or not is user map enabled for
usage.</p>

<p>Default: ipaEnabledFlag</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_user_category (string) The LDAP
attribute that contains user category such as
&acute;all&acute;.</p>

<p>Default: userCategory</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_host_category (string) The LDAP
attribute that contains host category such as
&acute;all&acute;.</p>

<p>Default: hostCategory</p>

<p>ipa_selinux_usermap_uuid (string) The LDAP attribute
that contains unique ID of the user map.</p>

<p>Default: ipaUniqueID</p>

<p>ipa_host_ssh_public_key (string) The LDAP attribute that
contains the host&acute;s SSH public keys.</p>

<p>Default: ipaSshPubKey</p>

<p>SUBDOMAINS PROVIDER The IPA subdomains provider behaves
slightly differently if it is configured explicitly or
implicitly.</p>

<p>If the option &acute;subdomains_provider = ipa&acute; is
found in the domain section of sssd.conf, the IPA subdomains
provider is configured explicitly, and all subdomain
requests are sent to the IPA server if necessary.</p>

<p>If the option &acute;subdomains_provider&acute; is not
set in the domain section of sssd.conf but there is the
option &acute;id_provider = ipa&acute;, the IPA subdomains
provider is configured implicitly. In this case, if a
subdomain request fails and indicates that the server does
not support subdomains, i.e. is not configured for trusts,
the IPA subdomains provider is disabled. After an hour or
after the IPA provider goes online, the subdomains provider
is enabled again.</p>

<p>FAILOVER The failover feature allows back ends to
automatically switch to a different server if the current
server fails.</p>

<p>Failover Syntax The list of servers is given as a
comma-separated list; any number of spaces is allowed around
the comma. The servers are listed in order of preference.
The list can contain any number of servers.</p>

<p>For each failover-enabled config option, two variants
exist: primary and backup. The idea is that servers in the
primary list are preferred and backup servers are only
searched if no primary servers can be reached. If a backup
server is selected, a timeout of 31 seconds is set. After
this timeout SSSD will periodically try to reconnect to one
of the primary servers. If it succeeds, it will replace the
current active (backup) server.</p>

<p>The Failover Mechanism The failover mechanism
distinguishes between a machine and a service. The back end
first tries to resolve the hostname of a given machine; if
this resolution attempt fails, the machine is considered
offline. No further attempts are made to connect to this
machine for any other service. If the resolution attempt
succeeds, the back end tries to connect to a service on this
machine. If the service connection attempt fails, then only
this particular service is considered offline and the back
end automatically switches over to the next service. The
machine is still considered online and might still be tried
for another service.</p>

<p>Further connection attempts are made to machines or
services marked as offline after a specified period of time;
this is currently hard coded to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If there are no more machines to try, the back end as a
whole switches to offline mode, and then attempts to
reconnect every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>SERVICE DISCOVERY The service discovery feature allows
back ends to automatically find the appropriate servers to
connect to using a special DNS query. This feature is not
supported for backup servers.</p>

<p>Configuration If no servers are specified, the back end
automatically uses service discovery to try to find a
server. Optionally, the user may choose to use both fixed
server addresses and service discovery by inserting a
special keyword, _srv_, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.</p>

<p>The domain name Please refer to the dns_discovery_domain
parameter in the sssd.conf(5) manual page for more
details.</p>

<p>The protocol The queries usually specify _tcp as the
protocol. Exceptions are documented in respective option
description.</p>

<p>See Also For more information on the service discovery
mechanism, refer to RFC 2782.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example assumes that SSSD is
correctly configured and example.com is one of the domains
in the [sssd] section. This examples shows only the ipa
provider-specific options.</p>

<p>[domain/example.com] id_provider = ipa ipa_server =
ipaserver.example.com ipa_hostname = myhost.example.com</p>
