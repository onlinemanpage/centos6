<p>NAME devicekit_power_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the devicekit_power processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
devicekit_power processes via flex- ible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The devicekit_power processes execute with the
devicekit_power_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep devicekit_power_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The devicekit_power_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,devicekit_power_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type&quot; file types. The default entrypoint
paths for the devicekit_power_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/libexec/upowerd,
/usr/libexec/devkit-power-daemon, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux devicekit_power policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their devicekit_power processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
devicekit_power:</p>

<p>devicekit_power_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a devicekit_power_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type devicekit_power_t
permissive. Per- missive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux devicekit_power policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their devicekit_power processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
devicekit_power:</p>

<p>devicekit_power_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the devicekit_power_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the devicekit_power_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type devicekit_power_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
