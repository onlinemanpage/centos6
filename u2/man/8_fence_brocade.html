<p>NAME fence_brocade - I/O Fencing agent for Brocade FC
switches</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS fence_brocade [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fence_brocade is an I/O Fencing agent which
can be used with Brocade FC switches. It logs into a Brocade
switch via telnet and disables a specified port. Disabling
the port which a machine is connected to effectively fences
that machine. Lengthy telnet connections to the switch
should be avoided while a GFS cluster is running because the
connection will block any necessary fencing actions.</p>

<p>fence_brocade accepts options on the command line as
well as from stdin. fenced sends parameters through stdin
when it execs the agent. fence_brocade can be run by itself
with command line options which is useful for testing.</p>

<p>After a fence operation has taken place the fenced
machine can no longer connect to the Brocade FC switch. When
the fenced machine is ready to be brought back into the GFS
cluster (after reboot) the port on the Brocade FC switch
needs to be enabled. This can be done by run- ning
fence_brocade and specifying the enable action.</p>
