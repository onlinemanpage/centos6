<p>crond_selinux(8) crond SELinux Policy documentation
crond_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME crond_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the crond processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. crond policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run crond with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to enable extra rules in the cron domain to
support fcron, you must turn on the fcron_crond boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fcron_crond 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system cron jobs to relabel
filesystem for restor- ing file contexts, you must turn on
the cron_can_relabel boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cron_can_relabel 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux crond policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their crond processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for crond:</p>

<p>cron_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cron_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as cron log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>cron_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cron_spool_t type, if you want to
store the cron files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/spool/fcron, /var/spool/cron/crontabs</p>

<p>cron_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cron_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the cron files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>cron_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cron_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the cron files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>crond_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the crond_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the crond_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/atd, /usr/sbin/fcron,
/usr/sbin/cron(d)?</p>

<p>crond_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the crond_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the crond_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>crond_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the crond_tmp_t type, if you want to
store crond tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>crond_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the crond_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the crond files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/crond?.pid, /var/run/crond?.reboot,
/var/run/fcron.pid, /var/run/fcron.fifo, /var/run/atd.pid,
/var/run/anacron.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux crond policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their crond pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for crond:</p>

<p>crond_t, cronjob_t, crontab_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
