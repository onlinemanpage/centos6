<p>NAME qmail_splogger_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the qmail_splogger processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
qmail_splogger processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The qmail_splogger processes execute with the
qmail_splogger_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by executing the ps command with the
-Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep qmail_splogger_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The qmail_splogger_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;qmail_splog- ger_exec_t&quot; file
type. The default entrypoint paths for the qmail_splogger_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/var/qmail/bin/splogger</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux qmail_splogger policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their qmail_splogger processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
qmail_splogger:</p>

<p>qmail_splogger_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a qmail_splogger_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type qmail_splogger_t
permissive. Per- missive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux qmail_splogger policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their qmail_splogger processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
qmail_splogger:</p>

<p>qmail_splogger_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qmail_splogger_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the qmail_splogger_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type qmail_splogger_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
