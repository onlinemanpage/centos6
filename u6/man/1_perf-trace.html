<p>PERF-TRACE(1) perf Manual PERF-TRACE(1)</p>

<p>NAME perf-trace - strace inspired tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf trace</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command will show the events associated
with the target, initially syscalls, but other system events
like pagefaults, task lifetime events, scheduling events,
etc.</p>

<p>Initially this is a live mode only tool, but eventually
will work with perf.data files like the other tools,
allowing a detached record from analysis phases.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a, --all-cpus System-wide collection from all
CPUs.</p>

<p>-e, --expr List of events to show, currently only
syscall names. Prefixing with ! shows all syscalls but the
ones specified. You may need to escape it.</p>

<p>-o, --output= Output file name.</p>

<p>-p, --pid= Record events on existing process ID (comma
separated list).</p>

<p>-t, --tid= Record events on existing thread ID (comma
separated list).</p>

<p>-u, --uid= Record events in threads owned by uid. Name
or number.</p>

<p>-v, --verbose= Verbosity level.</p>

<p>-i, --no-inherit Child tasks do not inherit
counters.</p>

<p>-m, --mmap-pages= Number of mmap data pages. Must be a
power of two.</p>

<p>-C, --cpu Collect samples only on the list of CPUs
provided. Multiple CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated
list with no space: 0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with
-: 0-2. In per-thread mode with inheritance mode on
(default), Events are captured only when the thread executes
on the designated CPUs. Default is to monitor all CPUs.</p>

<p>--duration: Show only events that had a duration greater
than N.M ms.</p>

<p>--sched: Accrue thread runtime and provide a summary at
the end of the session.</p>

<p>-i --input Process events from a given perf data
file.</p>
