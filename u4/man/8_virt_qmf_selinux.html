<p>virt_qmf_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
virt_qmvirt_qmf_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME virt_qmf_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the virt_qmf pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the virt_qmf
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The virt_qmf processes execute with the virt_qmf_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep virt_qmf_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The virt_qmf_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,virt_qmf_exec_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the virt_qmf_t
domain are the follow- ing:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/libvirt-qmf, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux virt_qmf policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their virt_qmf processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
virt_qmf:</p>

<p>virt_qmf_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a virt_qmf_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type virt_qmf_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux virt_qmf policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their virt_qmf processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for virt_qmf:</p>

<p>virt_qmf_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_qmf_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the virt_qmf_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type virt_qmf_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
