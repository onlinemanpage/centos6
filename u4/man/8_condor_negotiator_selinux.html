<p>NAME condor_negotiator_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the con- dor_negotiator processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
condor_negotiator processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The condor_negotiator processes execute with the
condor_negotiator_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep condor_negotiator_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The condor_negotiator_t SELinux type can be
entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,condor_negotia-
tor_exec_t,filesystem_type,file_type&quot; file types. The
default entry- point paths for the condor_negotiator_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/condor_negotiator, all files on
the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux condor_negotiator policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their condor_negotiator processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
condor_negotiator:</p>

<p>condor_negotiator_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a condor_negotiator_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type condor_negotiator_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux condor_negotiator policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their condor_negotiator
processes in as secure a method as possi- ble.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
condor_negotiator:</p>

<p>condor_negotiator_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the condor_negotiator_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
condor_negotiator_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
condor_negotiator_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
