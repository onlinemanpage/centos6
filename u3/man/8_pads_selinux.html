<p>pads_selinux(8) pads SELinux Policy documentation
pads_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME pads_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the pads processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures pads (Passive Asset
Detection System) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux pads policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pads processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for pads:</p>

<p>pads_config_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pads_config_t type, if you want to
treat the files as pads configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/pads-assets.csv, /etc/pads-ether-codes,
/etc/pads.conf, /etc/pads-signature-list</p>

<p>pads_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pads_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the pads_t domain.</p>

<p>pads_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pads_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the pads_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>pads_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pads_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the pads files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux pads policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their pads pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for pads:</p>

<p>pads_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
