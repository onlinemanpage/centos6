<p>lpr_selinux(8) lpr SELinux Policy documentation
lpr_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME lpr_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the lpr processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux lpr policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lpr processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for lpr:</p>

<p>lpr_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lpr_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the lpr_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/lpinfo, /usr/sbin/accept,
/usr/bin/cancel(.cups)?, /usr/bin/lp(.cups)?,
/usr/bin/lpstat(.cups)?, /usr/sbin/lpc(.cups)?,
/usr/local/linuxprinter/bin/l?lpr, /usr/bin/lpoptions,
/usr/bin/lpq(.cups)?, /usr/sbin/lpadmin,
/opt/gutenprint/s?bin(/.*)?, /usr/bin/lpr(.cups)?,
/usr/sbin/lpmove, /usr/bin/lprm(.cups)?</p>

<p>lpr_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lpr_tmp_t type, if you want to
store lpr temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux lpr policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their lpr processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for lpr:</p>

<p>lpr_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
