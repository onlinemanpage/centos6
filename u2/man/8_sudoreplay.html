<p>SUDOREPLAY(8) MAINTENANCE COMMANDS SUDOREPLAY(8)</p>

<p>NAME sudoreplay - replay sudo session logs</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sudoreplay [-d directory] [-f filter] [-m
max_wait] [-s speed_factor] ID</p>

<p>sudoreplay [-d directory] -l [search expression]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION sudoreplay plays back or lists the session
logs created by sudo. When replaying, sudoreplay can play
the session back in real-time, or the playback speed may be
adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command line
options. The ID should be a six character sequence of digits
and upper case letters, e.g. 0100A5, which is logged by sudo
when a command is run with session logging enabled.</p>

<p>In list mode, sudoreplay can be used to find the ID of a
session based on a number of criteria such as the user, tty
or command run.</p>

<p>In replay mode, if the standard output has not been
redirected, sudoreplay will act on the following keys:</p>

<p>(space) Pause output; press any key to resume.</p>

<p>&lt; Reduce the playback speed by one half.</p>

<p>&gt; Double the playback speed.</p>

<p>OPTIONS sudoreplay accepts the following command line
options:</p>

<p>-d directory Use directory to for the session logs
instead of the default, /var/log/sudo-io.</p>

<p>-f filter By default, sudoreplay will play back the
commands standard output, standard error and tty output. The
-f option can be used to select which of these to output.
The filter argument is a comma-separated list, consisting of
one or more of following: stdout, stderr, and ttyout.</p>

<p>-l Enable &quot;list mode&quot;. In this mode,
sudoreplay will list available session IDs. If a search
expression is specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs
that are displayed. An expression is composed of the
following predicates:</p>

<p>command command pattern Evaluates to true if the command
run matches command pattern. On systems with POSIX regular
expression support, the pattern may be an extended regular
expression. On systems without POSIX regular expression
support, a simple substring match is performed instead.</p>

<p>cwd directory Evaluates to true if the command was run
with the specified current working directory.</p>

<p>fromdate date Evaluates to true if the command was run
on or after date. See &quot;Date and time format&quot; for a
description of supported date and time formats.</p>

<p>group runas_group Evaluates to true if the command was
run with the specified runas_group. Note that unless a
runas_group was explicitly specified when sudo was run this
field will be empty in the log.</p>

<p>runas runas_user Evaluates to true if the command was
run as the specified runas_user. Note that sudo runs
commands as user root by default.</p>

<p>todate date Evaluates to true if the command was run on
or prior to date. See &quot;Date and time format&quot; for a
description of supported date and time formats.</p>

<p>tty tty Evaluates to true if the command was run on the
specified terminal device. The tty should be specified
without the /dev/ prefix, e.g. tty01 instead of
/dev/tty01.</p>

<p>user user name Evaluates to true if the ID matches a
command run by user name.</p>

<p>Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique
string (currently all predicates may be shortened to a
single character).</p>

<p>Predicates may be combined using and, or and ! operators
as well as &rsquo;(&rsquo; and &rsquo;)&rsquo; for grouping
(note that parentheses must generally be escaped from the
shell). The and operator is optional, adjacent predicates
have an implied and unless separated by an or.</p>

<p>-m max_wait Specify an upper bound on how long to wait
between key presses or output data. By default, sudo_replay
will accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or
program output. However, this can be tedious when the
session includes long pauses. When the -m option is
specified, sudoreplay will limit these pauses to at most
max_wait seconds. The value may be specified as a floating
point number, .e.g. 2.5.</p>

<p>-s speed_factor This option causes sudoreplay to adjust
the number of seconds it will wait between key presses or
program output. This can be used to slow down or speed up
the display. For example, a speed_factor of 2 would make the
output twice as fast whereas a speed_factor of &lt;.5&gt;
would make the output twice as slow.</p>

<p>-V The -V (version) option causes sudoreplay to print
its version number and exit.</p>

<p>Date and time format The time and date may be specified
multiple ways, common formats include:</p>

<p>HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone 24 hour time may be used
in place of am/pm.</p>

<p>HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone 24 hour time may be
used in place of am/pm, and month and day names may be
abbreviated. Note that month and day of the week names must
be specified in English.</p>

<p>CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ISO time format</p>

<p>DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS The month name may be
abbreviated.</p>

<p>Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and
timezone are optional. If no date is specified, the current
day is assumed; if no time is specified, the first second of
the specified date is used. The less significant parts of
both time and date may also be omitted, in which case zero
is assumed. For example, the following are all valid:</p>

<p>The following are all valid time and date
specifications:</p>

<p>now The current time and date.</p>

<p>tomorrow Exactly one day from now.</p>

<p>yesterday 24 hours ago.</p>

<p>2 hours ago 2 hours ago.</p>

<p>next Friday The first second of the next Friday.</p>

<p>this week The current time but the first day of the
coming week.</p>

<p>a fortnight ago The current time but 14 days ago.</p>

<p>10:01 am 9/17/2009 10:01 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>10:01 am 10:01 am on the current day.</p>

<p>10 10:00 am on the current day.</p>

<p>9/17/2009 00:00 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>10:01 am Sep 17, 2009 10:01 am, September 17, 2009.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/sudo-io The default I/O log
directory.</p>

<p>/var/log/sudo-io/00/00/01/log Example session log
info.</p>

<p>/var/log/sudo-io/00/00/01/stdin Example session standard

<p>Note that the stdin, stdout and stderr files will be

particular command.</p>
