<p>rct(8) Certificate Information Tool rct(8)</p>

<p>NAME rct - Displays information (headers) about or size
and statistics of a entitlement, product, or identity
certificate used by Red Hat Subscrip- tion Manager.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rct cat-cert [--no-content] [--no-products]
/path/to/certificate.pem rct stat-cert
/path/to/certificate.pem</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Red Hat Subscription Manager uses X.509
certificates to identify a reg- istered system (identity
certificate), the products installed on that system (product
certificates), and the subscriptions attached to the system
(entitlement certificates), including available content
reposi- tories, products, and support levels. All of the
information that Sub- scription Manager requires is
contained in the body of the certificate.</p>

<p>COMMANDS stat-cert Prints the size of the certificate
and other details about the certificate. The precise details
depend on the type of certifi- cate being checked.</p>

<p>cat-cert Prints the information that is contained in the
certificate itself, such as the certificate headers, serial
numbers, prod- ucts, and content sets. Two options,
--no-content and --no-prod- ucts, can be used to shorten the
output to include only header and descriptive
information.</p>

<p>THE STAT-CERT COMMAND The rct tool is used to gather
information about the already-issued certificates being used
by Subscription Manager. The main reason for that is that
certificate sizes, for a number of reasons, impact content
delivery service performance.</p>

<p>This command has no options.</p>

<p>For large accounts and organizations, there can be a
very large number of products and content sets available.
Older versions of entitlement certificates (version 1.0)
used different (less efficient) DER encod- ing, so that
large amounts of information results in very large cer-
tificates. (This is what caused timeouts or crashes when
dealing with some content services.) Newer entitlement
certificate versions (version 3.0) use more efficient
encoding on large content sets, , resulting in smaller
certificate content sizes and better service
performance.</p>

<p>If there are problems with the content service timing
out or returning errors, then the rct stat-cert command can
be used to check the size and version of a given entitlement
certificate quickly.</p>

<p>A large number of content sets is anything over 185
total sets. Both the total number of content sets and the
size of the DER encoding in the certificate could affect
performance.</p>

<p>The statistics for an entitlement certificate show both
the DER size and the number of content sets, among other
information:</p>

<p>* Type (entitlement certificate)</p>

<p>* Version (of the certificate style); newer versions
will be 3.x, with better performance for handling large
content sets</p>

<p>* DER size, which gives the size of the certificate
contents (not the size of the certificate file itself)</p>

<p>* Key size, for the associated key file, in bytes</p>

<p>* The total number of available content sets in the
subscription</p>

<p>For example: [root@server ~]# rct stat-cert
/etc/pki/entitlement/2027912482659389239.pem Type:
Entitlement Certificate Version: 1.0 DER size: 47555b
Subject Key ID size: 553b Content sets: 100</p>

<p>While the size of the certificate is less of an issue
for identity and product certificates (which are quite
small), the stat-cert command can still be used to view the
size and statistics of the certificates.</p>

<p>For a product certificate, the stat-cert command
shows:</p>

<p>* Type (product certificate)</p>

<p>* Version (of the certificate style)</p>

<p>* DER size, which gives the size of the certificate
contents (not the size of the certificate file itself)</p>

<p>For example: [root@server ~]# rct stat-cert
/etc/pki/product/69.pem Type: Product Certificate Version:
1.0 DER size: 1558b</p>

<p>For an identity certificate:</p>

<p>* Type (identity certificate)</p>

<p>* Version (of the certificate style)</p>

<p>* DER size, which gives the size of the certificate
contents (not the size of the certificate file itself)</p>

<p>* Key size, for the associated key file, in bytes</p>

<p>For example: [root@server ~]# rct stat-cert
/etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem Type: Identity Certificate
Version: 1.0 DER size: 1488b Subject Key ID size: 20b</p>

<p>CAT-CERT COMMAND Each certificate contains a complete
set of information with all of the details for whatever
element is being identified. That information can be
displayed, in pretty-print form, using the cat-cert
command.</p>

<p>The command returns the most basic information about the
certificate -- such as its directory path, its serial number
and subject name, and its validity period (start and end
dates) -- in the Certificate section:</p>

<p>* Path -- the filesystem location where the certificate
is installed</p>

<p>* Version -- the certificate format version -- P *
Serial -- the serial number for the certificate</p>

<p>* Start/End Date -- the validity period for the
certificate</p>

<p>* Alt Name -- the subject alternative name, which uses
the host- name of the system rather than the UUID (for
identity certifi- cates only)</p>

<p>The Subject DN of the certificate is in the Subject
section.</p>

<p>For example, for the identity certificate: [root@server
~]# rct cat-cert /etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem</p>

<p>Subject: CN: e94bc90e-44a1-4f8c-b6fc-0a3e9d6fac2b</p>

<p>A product certificate contains additional information in
a Product sec- tion, which defines the information for the
specific installed product, such as its name, product
version, and any yum tags used for that prod- uct. For
example: [root@server ~]# rct cat-cert
/etc/pki/product/69.pem</p>

<p>Product: ID: 69 Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server
Version: 6.4 Arch: x86_64 Tags: rhel-6,rhel-6-server</p>

<p>The most information is contained in the entitlement
certficate. Along with the Certificate and Subject, it also
has a Product section that defines the product group that is
covered by the subscription.</p>

<p>Then, it contains an Order section that details
everything related to the purchase of the subscription (such
as the contract number, service level, total quantity,
quantities assigned to the system, and other details on the
subscription).</p>

<p>A subscription for a product covers the version
purchased and every previous version of the product. For
example, when a subscription is purchased for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4, the subscription provides full access
to all RHEL 6 repositories, plus access to all RHEL 5
repositories and then other included product content
repositories, like Subscription Asset Manager. Every
available content repository is listed in a Content section
that contains the repository name, associ- ated tags, its
URL, and a notice on whether the yum repository is enabled
by default. For example: [root@server ~]# rct cat-cert
/etc/pki/entitlement/2027912482659389239.pem

<p>Using the --no-content option when running rct cat-cert
with an enti- tlement certificate returns all of the
certification information, order information, and product
information, but excludes all of the Content sections, which
significantly reduced the information printed to std- out.
If there are a lot of Product sections, as well, then those
can be excluded using the --no-product option.</p>
