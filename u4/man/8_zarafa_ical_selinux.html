<p>zarafa_ical_selinSELinux Policy documentation for
zarafazarafa_ical_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME zarafa_ical_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the zarafa_ical processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
zarafa_ical processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The zarafa_ical processes execute with the zarafa_ical_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep zarafa_ical_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The zarafa_ical_t SELinux type can be
entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type,zarafa_ical_exec_t&quot; file types. The
default entry- point paths for the zarafa_ical_t domain are
the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/usr/bin/zarafa-ical</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux zarafa_ical policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their zarafa_ical processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
zarafa_ical:</p>

<p>zarafa_ical_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a zarafa_ical_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type zarafa_ical_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux zarafa_ical policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their zarafa_ical processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
zarafa_ical:</p>

<p>zarafa_ical_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zarafa_ical_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the zarafa_ical_t
domain.</p>

<p>zarafa_ical_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zarafa_ical_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as zarafa ical log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>zarafa_ical_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zarafa_ical_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the zarafa ical files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type zarafa_ical_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
