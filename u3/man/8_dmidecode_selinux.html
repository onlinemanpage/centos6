documentationdmidecode_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME dmidecode_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the dmidecode processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures dmidecode (Decode DMI
data for x86/ia64 bioses) processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux dmidecode policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their dmidecode processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for dmidecode:</p>

<p>dmidecode_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dmidecode_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the dmidecode_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/dmidecode, /usr/sbin/ownership,
/usr/sbin/vpddecode</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux dmidecode policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their dmide- code processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
dmidecode:</p>

<p>dmidecode_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
