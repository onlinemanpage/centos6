<p>mpicxx(1) MPI mpicxx(1)</p>

<p>NAME mpicxx - Compiles and links MPI programs written in
C++</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command can be used to compile and link
MPI programs written in C++. It provides the options and any
special libraries that are needed to compile and link MPI
programs.</p>

<p>It is important to use this command, particularly when
linking pro- grams, as it provides the necessary
libraries.</p>

<p>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS -show - Show the commands that
would be used without runnning them -help - Give short help
-cxx=name - Use compiler name instead of the default choice.
Use this only if the compiler is compatible with the MPICH
library (see below) -config=name - Load a configuration file
for a particular compiler. This allows a single mpicxx
command to be used with multiple compil- ers. -compile_info
- Show the steps for compiling a program. This option can be
used to see what options and include paths are used by
mpicxx. -link_info - Show the steps for linking a program.
This optoin can be used to see what options and libraries
are used by mpicxx. -profile=name - Use the MPI profiling
given by name. See below for details -mpe=name - Use an MPE
profiling library. The behavior is similar to using
-profile=mpe_name.conf .</p>

<p>-echo - Show exactly what this program is doing. This
option should normally not be used. others - are passed to
the compiler or linker. For example, -c causes files to be
compiled, -g selects compilation with debugging on most
systems, and -o name causes linking with the output exe-
cutable given the name name .</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES The environment variables
MPICH_CXX may be used to select different C++ compiler and
linker. Note that since MPICH is built with a particular C
and Fortran compiler, changing the compilers used can cause
problems. Use this only if you could intermix code compiled
with the different compilers.</p>

<p>The environment variable MPICC_PROFILE specifies a
profile library and has the same effect as if
-profile=$MPICC_PROFILE were used as an argu- ment to mpicc
. See the discussion of -profile below for more details.</p>

<p>COMPATIBLE COMPILERS The MPI library may be used with
any compiler that uses the same lengths for basic data
objects (such as long double ) and that uses compatible
run-time libraries. On many systems, the various compilers
are compatible and may be used interchangably. There are
exceptions; if you use the MPICH_CXX environment variable or
the -cxx=name command- line argument to override the choice
of compiler and encounter prob- lems, try reconfiguring
MPICH2 with the new compiler, and installing MPICH2 in a
separate location. See the installation manual for more
details.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES To compile a single file foo.c , use mpicxx -c
foo.cxx</p>

<p>To link the output and make an executable, use mpicxx -o
foo foo.o</p>

<p>Combining compilation and linking in a single command
mpicxx -o foo foo.cxx</p>

<p>is a convenient way to build simple programs.</p>

<p>SELECTING A PROFILING LIBRARY The -profile=name argument
allows you to specify an MPI profiling library to be used.
name can have two forms:</p>

<p>A library in the same directory as the MPI library The
name of a profile configuration file</p>

<p>If name is a library, then this library is included
before the MPI library. This allows the simple use of
libraries that make use of the MPI profiling interface and
that are installed in the same directory as the MPI
library.</p>

<p>If name.conf is the name of a file in the sysconfdir
directory, then this is read and may define the following
variables: PROFILE_PRELIB - Libraries (and paths) to include
before the MPI library PROFILE_POSTLIB - Libraries to
include after the MPI library PROFILE_INCPATHS - C
preprocessor arguments for any include files For example, to
add /usr/local/myprof/include to the include path and the
library libmyprof.a in /usr/local/myprof/lib to the link
step, you could create the file myprof.conf with the
lines</p>

<p>PROFILE_PRELIB=&quot;-L/usr/local/myprof/lib
-lmyprof&quot;
PROFILE_INCPATHS=&quot;-I/usr/local/myprof/include&quot;</p>

<p>and place it in the sysconfdir directory (this directory
is set at configure time when MPICH is built). Then using
the command- line argument -profile=myprof will cause these
definitions to be added to the relevant compile
commands.</p>
