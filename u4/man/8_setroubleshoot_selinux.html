<p>NAME setroubleshoot_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the setrou- bleshoot processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures setroubleshoot
(SELinux troubleshooting service) processes via flexible
mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux setroubleshoot policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
setroubleshoot:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_fixit_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
setroubleshoot_fixit_t domain.</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_var_lib_t type, if
you want to store the setroubleshoot files under the
/var/lib directory.</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_var_log_t type, if
you want to treat the data as setroubleshoot var log data,
usually stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshoot_var_run_t type, if
you want to store the setroubleshoot files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>setroubleshootd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the setroubleshootd_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the setroubleshootd_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux setroubleshoot policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their setroubleshoot processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
setroubleshoot:</p>

<p>setroubleshoot_fixit_t, setroubleshootd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
