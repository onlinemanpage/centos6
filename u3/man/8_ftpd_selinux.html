<p>ftpd_selinux(8) ftpd SELinux Policy documentation
ftpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ftpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the ftpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. ftpd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run ftpd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp to read and write files in the
user home directorie, you must turn on the ftp_home_dir
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P ftp_home_dir 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to login to local users
and read/write all files on the system, governed by DAC, you
must turn on the allow_ftpd_full_access boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ftpd_full_access 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to use connect to mysql
databas, you must turn on the ftpd_connect_db boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P ftpd_connect_db 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to use cifs used for
public file transfer services, you must turn on the
allow_ftpd_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ftpd_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to use nfs used for
public file trans- fer services, you must turn on the
allow_ftpd_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ftpd_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow httpd to act as a FTP server by
listening on the ftp port, you must turn on the
httpd_enable_ftp_server boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_enable_ftp_server 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow ftpd servers to read the /var/ftpd directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/ftpd(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/ftpd</p>

<p>Allow ftpd servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming
by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and
by restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_ftpd_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/ftpd/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/ftpd/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow tftp to modify public files used
for public file transfer services., you must turn on the
tftp_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P tftp_anon_write 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to upload files, used
for public file transfer services. Directories must be
labeled public_content_rw_t., you must turn on the
allow_ftpd_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ftpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ftpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ftpd:</p>

<p>ftpd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_etc_t type, if you want to
store ftpd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>ftpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ftpd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/vsftpd, /usr/sbin/ftpwho,
/etc/cron.monthly/proftpd, /usr/sbin/muddleftpd,
/usr/sbin/in.ftpd, /usr/sbin/proftpd,
/usr/kerberos/sbin/ftpd</p>

<p>ftpd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the ftpd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/proftpd,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsftpd</p>

<p>ftpd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>ftpd_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as ftpd lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>ftpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store ftpd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>ftpd_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store ftpd files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>ftpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the ftpd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>ftpdctl_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpdctl_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ftpdctl_t domain.</p>

<p>ftpdctl_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ftpdctl_tmp_t type, if you want to
store ftpdctl temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux ftpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ftpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for ftpd:</p>

<p>ftp_data_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>ftp_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ftpd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their ftpd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for ftpd:</p>

<p>ftpd_t, ftpdctl_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
