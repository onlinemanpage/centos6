<p>xdm_selinux(8) xdm SELinux Policy documentation
xdm_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME xdm_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the xdm processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. xdm policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run xdm with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow xdm logins as sysad, you must turn
on the xdm_sysadm_login boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_sysadm_login 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows xdm to execute bootloade, you must
turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux xdm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xdm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for xdm:</p>

<p>xdm_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_etc_t type, if you want to
store xdm files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>xdm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the xdm_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/slim, /usr/(s)?bin/lxdm,
/usr/X11R6/bin/[xgkw]dm, /usr/(s)?bin/gdm-binary,
/usr/(s)?bin/[xgkw]dm, /usr/(s)?bin/lxdm- binary,
/usr/bin/gpe-dm, /opt/kde3/bin/kdm</p>

<p>xdm_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_home_t type, if you want to
store xdm files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>xdm_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as xdm lock data, stored under the /var/lock
directory</p>

<p>xdm_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as xdm log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/slim.log.*, /var/log/lxdm.log.*,
/var/log/gdm(/.*)?</p>

<p>xdm_rw_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_rw_etc_t type, if you want to
store xdm rw files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>xdm_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_spool_t type, if you want to
store the xdm files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>xdm_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_tmp_t type, if you want to
store xdm temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /tmp/.X0-lock, /tmp/.X11-unix(/.*)?,
/tmp/.ICE-unix(/.*)?</p>

<p>xdm_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store xdm files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>xdm_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the xdm files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/lxdm(/.*)?, /var/lib/[gxkw]dm(/.*)?,
/var/cache/gdm(/.*)?</p>

<p>xdm_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xdm_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the xdm files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/kdm(/.*)?, /var/run/slim.*,
/var/run/gdm(/.*)?, /var/run/lxdm.auth,
/var/run/xauth(/.*)?, /var/run/xdmctl(/.*)?,
/var/run/[gx]dm.pid, /usr/lib(64)?/qt-.*/etc/settings(/.*)?,
/var/run/lxdm(/*.)?, /var/run/slim(/.*)?,
/var/run/gdm_socket, /etc/kde3?/kdm/backgroundrc,
/var/run/lxdm.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux xdm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xdm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for xdm:</p>

<p>xdmcp_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux xdm policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their xdm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for xdm:</p>

<p>xdm_t, xdm_dbusd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
