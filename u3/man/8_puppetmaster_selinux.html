<p>puppetmaster_selinupuppetmaster SELinux Policy
documentpuppetmaster_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME puppetmaster_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the puppet- master processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. puppet- master policy is
extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you
to manipulate the policy and run puppetmaster with the
tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Puppet master to use connect to
mysql and post- gresql databas, you must turn on the
puppetmaster_use_db boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P puppetmaster_use_db 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux puppetmaster policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their puppetmaster processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
puppetmaster:</p>

<p>puppetmaster_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the puppetmaster_t
domain.</p>

<p>puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
puppetmaster_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>puppetmaster_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_tmp_t type, if you
want to store pup- petmaster temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux puppetmaster policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pup- petmaster processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
puppetmaster:</p>

<p>puppetmaster_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
