<p>roundup_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
roundup roundup_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME roundup_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the roundup pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the roundup
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The roundup processes execute with the roundup_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep roundup_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The roundup_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;roundup_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the roundup_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/roundup-server</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux roundup policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their roundup processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for roundup:</p>

<p>roundup_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a roundup_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type roundup_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux roundup policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their roundup processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for roundup:</p>

<p>roundup_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the roundup_t domain.</p>

<p>roundup_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the roundup_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>roundup_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the roundup files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>roundup_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the roundup files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type roundup_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>roundup_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/roundup(/.*)?</p>

<p>roundup_var_run_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
