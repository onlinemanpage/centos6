<p>privoxy_selinux(8) privoxy SELinux Policy documentation
privoxy_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME privoxy_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the privoxy pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures privoxy (Privacy
enhancing web proxy) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. privoxy policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run privoxy with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow privoxy to connect to all ports,
not just HTTP, FTP, and Gopher ports, you must turn on the
privoxy_connect_any boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P privoxy_connect_any 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux privoxy policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their privoxy processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for privoxy:</p>

<p>privoxy_etc_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the privoxy_etc_rw_t type, if you want
to treat the files as privoxy etc read/write content.</p>

<p>privoxy_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the privoxy_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the privoxy_t domain.</p>

<p>privoxy_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the privoxy_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the privoxy_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>privoxy_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the privoxy_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as privoxy log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>privoxy_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the privoxy_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the privoxy files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux privoxy policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their privoxy processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for privoxy:</p>

<p>privoxy_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
