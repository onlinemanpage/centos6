<p>cobblerd_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
cobblercobblerd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME cobblerd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the cobblerd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cobblerd
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The cobblerd processes execute with the cobblerd_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep cobblerd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The cobblerd_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;cobblerd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the cobblerd_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/cobblerd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cobblerd processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobblerd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a cobblerd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type cobblerd_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. cob- blerd policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run cobblerd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access nfs file systems,
you must turn on the cobbler_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to connect to the network
using TCP, you must turn on the cobbler_can_network_connect
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow HTTPD scripts and modules to
connect to cobbler over the network, you must turn on the
httpd_can_network_connect_cob- bler boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access cifs file
systems, you must turn on the cobbler_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to modify public files used
for public file transfer services, you must turn on the
cobbler_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_anon_write 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access nfs file systems,
you must turn on the cobbler_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to connect to the network
using TCP, you must turn on the cobbler_can_network_connect
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow HTTPD scripts and modules to
connect to cobbler over the network, you must turn on the
httpd_can_network_connect_cob- bler boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access cifs file
systems, you must turn on the cobbler_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow cobblerd servers to read the /var/cobblerd
directory by adding the public_content_t file type to the
directory and by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/cobblerd(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/cobblerd</p>

<p>Allow cobblerd servers to read and write
/var/tmp/incoming by adding the public_content_rw_t type to
the directory and by restoring the file type. This also
requires the allow_cobblerdd_anon_write boolean to be
set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/cobblerd/incom- ing(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R
-v /var/cobblerd/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to modify public files used
for public file transfer services., you must turn on the
cobbler_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cobblerd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobblerd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobblerd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the cobblerd_t domain.</p>

<p>cobblerd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobblerd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the cobblerd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cobblerd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobbler_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 25151</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type cobblerd_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>
