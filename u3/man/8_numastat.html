<p>NAME numastat - Print statistics about NUMA memory
allocation</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS numastat</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION numastat displays NUMA allocations
statistics from the kernel memory allocator. Each process
has NUMA policies that specifies on which node pages are
allocated. See set_mempolicy(2) or numactl(8) on details of
the available policies. The numastat counters keep track on
what nodes memory is finally allocated.</p>

<p>The counters are separated for each node. Each count
event is the allo- cation of a page of memory.</p>

<p>numa_hit is the number of allocations where an
allocation was intended for that node and succeeded
there.</p>

<p>numa_miss shows how often an allocation was intended for
this node, but ended up on another node due to low
memory.</p>

<p>numa_foreign is the number of allocations that were
intended for another node, but ended up on this node. Each
numa_foreign event has a numa_miss on another node.</p>

<p>interleave_hit is the number of interleave policy
allocations that were intended for a specific node and
succeeded there.</p>

<p>local_node is incremented when a process running on the
node allocated memory on the same node.</p>

<p>other_node is incremented when a process running on
another node allo- cated memory on that node.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO numactl(8) set_mempolicy(2) numa(3)</p>

<p>NOTES numastat output is only available on NUMA
systems.</p>

<p>numastat assumes the output terminal has a width of 80
characters and tries to format the output accordingly.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES watch -n1 numastat watch -n1
--differences=accumulative numastat</p>

<p>FILES /sys/devices/system/node/node*/numastat</p>

<p>BUGS The output formatting on machines with a large
number of nodes could be improved.</p>
