<p>named_selinux(8) named SELinux Policy documentation
named_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME named_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the named processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures named (Berkeley
internet name domain DNS server) processes via flexible
mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. named policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run named with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow BIND to write the master zone
files. Generally this is used for dynamic DNS or zone
transfers, you must turn on the named_write_master_zones
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P named_write_master_zones 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux named policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their named processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for named:</p>

<p>named_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_cache_t type, if you want to
store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/named/slaves(/.*)?,
/var/named/chroot/var/named/data(/.*)?,
/var/named/chroot/var/tmp(/.*)?, /var/named/data(/.*)?,
/var/named/chroot/var/named/slaves(/.*)?,
/var/named/dynamic(/.*)?,
/var/named/chroot/var/named/dynamic(/.*)?</p>

<p>named_checkconf_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_checkconf_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the named_checkconf_t
domain.</p>

<p>named_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as named configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/named/chroot/etc/named.root.hints,
/var/named/chroot(/.*)?, /var/named/named.ca,
/etc/unbound(/.*)?,
/var/named/chroot/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf,
/etc/named.root.hints,
/var/named/chroot/etc/named.rfc1912.zones,
/etc/named.rfc1912.zones,
/etc/named.caching-nameserver.conf, /etc/named.conf,
/var/named/chroot/var/named/named.ca,
/var/named/chroot/etc/named.conf, /etc/rndc.*</p>

<p>named_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the named_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/unbound, /usr/sbin/named,
/usr/sbin/lwresd</p>

<p>named_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the named_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/named,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/unbound</p>

<p>named_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>named_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as named log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/named.*,
/var/named/chroot/var/log/named.*</p>

<p>named_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_tmp_t type, if you want to
store named tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>named_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the named files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/named/chroot/var/run/named.*, /var/run/ndc,
/var/run/bind(/.*)?, /var/run/named(/.*)?,
/var/run/unbound(/.*)?</p>

<p>named_zone_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the named_zone_t type, if you want to
treat the files as named zone data.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/named/chroot/var/named(/.*)?,
/var/named(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux named policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their named pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for named:</p>

<p>named_t, namespace_init_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
