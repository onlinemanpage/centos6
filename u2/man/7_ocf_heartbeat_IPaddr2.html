OCF_HEARTBEAT_IPADDR(7)</p>

<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_IPaddr2 - Manages virtual IPv4
addresses (Linux specific version)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS IPaddr2 [start | stop | status | monitor |
meta-data | validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This Linux-specific resource manages IP
alias IP addresses. It can add an IP alias, or remove one.
In addition, it can implement Cluster Alias IP functionality
if invoked as a clone resource.</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS ip The IPv4 address to be
configured in dotted quad notation, for example
&quot;192.168.1.1&quot;. (unique, required, string, no
default)</p>

<p>nic The base network interface on which the IP address
will be brought online. .sp If left empty, the script will
try and determine this from the routing table. .sp Do NOT
specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or anything
here; rather, specify the base interface only. .sp
Prerequisite: .sp There must be at least one static IP
address, which is not managed by the cluster, assigned to
the network interface. .sp If you can not assign any static
IP address on the interface, modify this kernel parameter:
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.promote_secondaries=1 (or per
device) .sp</p>

<p>(optional, string, default eth0)</p>

<p>cidr_netmask The netmask for the interface in CIDR
format (e.g., 24 and not 255.255.255.0) .sp If unspecified,
the script will also try to determine this from the routing
table. (optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>broadcast Broadcast address associated with the IP. If
left empty, the script will determine this from the netmask.
(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>iflabel You can specify an additional label for your IP
address here. This label is appended to your interface name.
If a label is specified in nic name, this parameter has no
effect. (optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>lvs_support Enable support for LVS Direct Routing
configurations. In case a IP address is stopped, only move
it to the loopback device to allow the local node to
continue to service requests, but no longer advertise it on
the network. (optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>mac Set the interface MAC address explicitly. Currently
only used in case of the Cluster IP Alias. Leave empty to
chose automatically. .sp</p>

<p>(optional, string, no default)</p>

<p>clusterip_hash Specify the hashing algorithm used for
the Cluster IP functionality. .sp</p>

<p>(optional, string, default sourceip-sourceport)</p>

<p>unique_clone_address If true, add the clone ID to the
supplied value of ip to create a unique address to manage
(optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>arp_interval Specify the interval between unsolicited
ARP packets in milliseconds. (optional, integer, default
200)</p>

<p>arp_count Number of unsolicited ARP packets to send.
(optional, integer, default 5)</p>

<p>arp_bg Whether or not to send the arp packets in the
background. (optional, string, default yes)</p>

<p>arp_mac MAC address to send the ARP packets too. .sp You
really shouldn&acute;t be touching this. .sp</p>

<p>(optional, string, default ffffffffffff)</p>

<p>flush_routes Flush the routing table on stop. This is
for applications which use the cluster IP address and which
run on the same physical host that the IP address lives on.
The Linux kernel may force that application to take a
shortcut to the local loopback interface, instead of the
interface the address is really bound to. Under those
circumstances, an application may, somewhat unexpectedly,
continue to use connections for some time even after the IP
address is deconfigured. Set this parameter in order to
immediately disable said shortcut when the IP address goes
away. (optional, boolean, default false)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>status Performs a status check. Suggested minimum
timeout: 20s. Suggested interval: 10s.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 20s. Suggested interval: 10s.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5s.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 20s.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
IPaddr2 resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive p_IPaddr2 ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 params
ip=string op monitor depth=&quot;0&quot;
timeout=&quot;20s&quot; interval=&quot;10s&quot;</p>
