<p>virt-rescue(1) Virtualization Support virt-rescue(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-rescue - Run a rescue shell on a virtual
machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-rescue [--options] -d domname</p>

<p>virt-rescue [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img
...]</p>

<p>Old style:</p>

<p>virt-rescue [--options] domname</p>

<p>virt-rescue [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>WARNING You must not use &quot;virt-rescue&quot; on live
virtual machines. Doing so will probably result in disk
corruption in the VM. &quot;virt-rescue&quot; tries to stop
you from doing this, but doesnt catch all cases.</p>

<p>However if you use the --ro (read only) option, then you
can attach a shell to a live virtual machine. The results
might be strange or inconsistent at times but you wont get
disk corruption.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-rescue is like a Rescue CD, but for
virtual machines, and without the need for a CD. virt-rescue
gives you a rescue shell and some simple recovery tools
which you can use to examine or rescue a virtual machine or
disk image.</p>

<p>You can run virt-rescue on any virtual machine known to
libvirt, or directly on disk image(s):</p>

<p>virt-rescue -d GuestName</p>

<p>virt-rescue --ro -a /path/to/disk.img</p>

<p>virt-rescue -a /dev/sdc</p>

<p>For live VMs you must use the --ro option.</p>

<p>When you run virt-rescue on a virtual machine or disk
image, you are placed in an interactive bash shell where you
can use many ordinary Linux commands. What you see in
&quot;/&quot; (&quot;/bin&quot;, &quot;/lib&quot; etc) is
the rescue appliance. You must mount the virtual machine s
filesystems by hand. There is an empty directory called
&quot;/sysroot&quot; where you can mount filesystems.</p>

<p>In the example below, we list logical volumes, then
choose one to mount under &quot;/sysroot&quot;:</p>

<p>&gt;&lt;rescue&gt; lvs LV VG Attr LSize Origin Snap%
Move Log Copy% Convert lv_root vg_f11x64 -wi-a- 8.83G
lv_swap vg_f11x64 -wi-a- 992.00M &gt;&lt;rescue&gt; mount
/dev/vg_f11x64/lv_root /sysroot &gt;&lt;rescue&gt; ls
/sysroot</p>

<p>If you don t know what filesystems are available on the
virtual machine then you can use commands such as parted(8)
and lvs(8) to find out.</p>

<p>NOTES Virt-rescue can be used on any disk image file or
device, not just a virtual machine. For example you can use
it on a blank file if you want to partition that file
(although we would recommend using guestfish(1) instead as
it is more suitable for this purpose). You can even use
virt-rescue on things like SD cards.</p>

<p>Virt-rescue does not require root. You only need to run
it as root if you need root to open the disk image.</p>

<p>This tool is just designed for quick interactive hacking
on a virtual machine. For more structured access to a
virtual machine disk image, you should use guestfs(3). To
get a structured shell that you can use to make scripted
changes to guests, use guestfish(1).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>-a file --add file Add file which should be a disk image
from a virtual machine. If the virtual machine has multiple
block devices, you must supply all of them with separate -a
options.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>--append kernelopts Pass additional options to the
rescue kernel.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly (-a), then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>-d guest --domain guest Add all the disks from the named
libvirt guest.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format The default for the -a
option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image. Using
this forces the disk format for -a options which follow on
the command line. Using --format with no argument switches
back to auto-detection for subsequent -a options.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>virt-rescue --format=raw -a disk.img</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot;.</p>

<p>virt-rescue --format=raw -a disk.img --format -a
another.img</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot; and reverts to auto-detection for
&quot;another.img&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you
should use this option to specify the disk format. This
avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests
(CVE-2010-3851).</p>

<p>-m MB --memsize MB Change the amount of memory allocated
to the rescue system. The default is set by libguestfs and
is small but adequate for running system tools. The
occasional program might need more memory. The parameter is
specified in megabytes.</p>

<p>--network Enable QEMU user networking in the guest. See
&quot;NETWORK&quot;.</p>

<p>-r --ro Open the image read-only.</p>

<p>The option must always be used if the disk image or
virtual machine might be running, and is generally
recommended in cases where you dont need write access to the
disk.</p>

<p>--selinux Enable SELinux in the rescue appliance. You
should read &quot;SELINUX&quot; in guestfs(3) before using
this option.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages for debugging.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-x Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.</p>

<p>OLD-STYLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS Previous versions of
virt-rescue allowed you to write either:</p>

<p>virt-rescue disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>virt-rescue guestname</p>

<p>whereas in this version you should use -a or -d
respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk image
might have the same name as a guest.</p>

<p>For compatibility the old style is still supported.</p>

<p>NETWORK Adding the --network option enables QEMU user
networking in the rescue appliance. There are some
differences between user networking and ordinary
networking:</p>

<p>ping does not work Because the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST
protocol generally requires root in order to send the ping
packets, and because virt-rescue must be able to run as
non-root, QEMU user networking is not able to emulate the
ping(8) command. The ping command will appear to resolve
addresses but will not be able to send or receive any
packets. This does not mean that the network is not
working.</p>

<p>cannot receive connections QEMU user networking cannot
receive incoming connections.</p>

<p>making TCP connections The virt-rescue appliance needs
to be small and so does not include many network tools. In
particular there is no telnet(1) command. You can make TCP
connections from the shell using the magical
&quot;/dev/tcp/&lt;hostname&gt;/&lt;port&gt;&quot;
syntax:</p>

<p>exec 3&lt;&gt;/dev/tcp/redhat.com/80 echo &quot;GET
/&quot; &gt;&amp;3 cat &lt;&amp;3</p>

<p>See bash(1) for more details.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES Several environment variables
affect virt-rescue. See &quot;ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES&quot; in
guestfs(3) for the complete list.</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
