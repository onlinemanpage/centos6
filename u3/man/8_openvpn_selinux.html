<p>openvpn_selinux(8) openvpn SELinux Policy documentation
openvpn_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME openvpn_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the openvpn pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures openvpn (full-featured
SSL VPN solution) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. openvpn policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run openvpn with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow openvpn to read home directorie,
you must turn on the openvpn_enable_homedirs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P openvpn_enable_homedirs 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux openvpn policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their openvpn processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for openvpn:</p>

<p>openvpn_etc_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_etc_rw_t type, if you want
to treat the files as openvpn etc read/write content.</p>

<p>openvpn_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_etc_t type, if you want to
store openvpn files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>openvpn_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the openvpn_t domain.</p>

<p>openvpn_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the openvpn_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>openvpn_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_tmp_t type, if you want to
store openvpn temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>openvpn_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_var_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as openvpn var log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>openvpn_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openvpn_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the openvpn files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux openvpn policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their openvpn processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for openvpn:</p>

<p>openvpn_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux openvpn policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their openvpn processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for openvpn:</p>

<p>openvpn_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
