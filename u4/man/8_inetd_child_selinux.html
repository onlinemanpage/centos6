<p>inetd_child_selinSELinux Policy documentation for
inetd_inetd_child_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME inetd_child_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the inetd_child processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
inetd_child processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The inetd_child processes execute with the inetd_child_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep inetd_child_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The inetd_child_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,inetd_child_exec_t,filesys-
tem_type,file_type&quot; file types. The default entrypoint
paths for the inetd_child_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/in..*d,
/usr/local/lib/pysieved/pysieved.*.py, /usr/sbin/identd, all
files on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux inetd_child policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their inetd_child processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
inetd_child:</p>

<p>inetd_child_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a inetd_child_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type inetd_child_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux inetd_child policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their inetd_child processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
inetd_child:</p>

<p>inetd_child_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the inetd_child_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the inetd_child_t
domain.</p>

<p>inetd_child_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the inetd_child_tmp_t type, if you want
to store inetd child temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>inetd_child_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the inetd_child_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the inetd child files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux inetd_child policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their inetd_child processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for
inetd_child:</p>

<p>inetd_child_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp
1,7,9,13,19,37,512,543,544,891,892,2105,5666 udp
1,7,9,13,19,37,891,892</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type inetd_child_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
