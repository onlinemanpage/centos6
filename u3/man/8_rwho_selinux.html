<p>rwho_selinux(8) rwho SELinux Policy documentation
rwho_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME rwho_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the rwho processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures rwho (Who is logged in
on other machines?) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for rwho:</p>

<p>rwho_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rwho_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the rwho_t domain.</p>

<p>rwho_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rwho_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the rwho_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>rwho_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rwho_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as rwho log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>rwho_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rwho_spool_t type, if you want to
store the rwho files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for rwho:</p>

<p>rwho_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their rwho pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for rwho:</p>

<p>rwho_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
