<p>NAME perf-trace - strace inspired tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf trace</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command will show the events associated
with the target, initially syscalls, but other system events
like pagefaults, task lifetime events, scheduling events,
etc.</p>

<p>Initially this is a live mode only tool, but eventually
will work with perf.data files like the other tools,
allowing a detached record from analysis phases.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --all-cpus System-wide collection from all
CPUs.</p>

<p>-p, --pid= Record events on existing process ID (comma
separated list).</p>

<p>--tid= Record events on existing thread ID (comma
separated list).</p>

<p>--uid= Record events in threads owned by uid. Name or
number.</p>

<p>--no-inherit Child tasks do not inherit counters.</p>

<p>--mmap-pages= Number of mmap data pages. Must be a power
of two.</p>

<p>--cpu Collect samples only on the list of CPUs provided.
Multiple CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated list with
no space: 0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2. In
per-thread mode with inheritance mode on (default), Events
are captured only when the thread executes on the designated
CPUs. Default is to monitor all CPUs.</p>

<p>--duration: Show only events that had a duration greater
than N.M ms.</p>

<p>--sched: Accrue thread runtime and provide a summary at
the end of the session.</p>
