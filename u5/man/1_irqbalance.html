<p>IRQBALANCE(1) irqbalance IRQBALANCE(1)</p>

<p>NAME irqbalance - distribute hardware interrupts across
processors on a mul- tiprocessor system</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS irqbalance</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The purpose of irqbalance is distribute
hardware interrupts across pro- cessors on a multiprocessor
system in order to increase performance.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --oneshot Causes irqbalance to be run once,
after which the daemon exits</p>

<p>--debug Causes irqbalance to print extra debug
information. Implies --foreground</p>

<p>--foreground Causes irqbalance to run in the foreground
(without --debug)</p>

<p>--hintpolicy=[exact | subset | ignore] Set the policy
for how irq kernel affinity hinting is treated. Can be one
of:</p>

<p>exact irq affinity hint is applied unilaterally and
never violated</p>

<p>subset irq is balanced, but the assigned object will be
a subset of the affintiy hint</p>

<p>ignore irq affinity hint value is completely ignored</p>

<p>--powerthresh=&lt;threshold&gt; Set the threshold at
which we attempt to move a cpu into power- save mode If more
than &lt;threshold&gt; cpus are more than 1 standard
deviation below the average cpu softirq workload, and no
cpus are more than 1 standard deviation above (and have more
than 1 irq assigned to them), attempt to place 1 cpu in
powersave mode. In powersave mode, a cpu will not have any
irqs balanced to it, in an effort to prevent that cpu from
waking up without need.</p>

<p>--banirq=&lt;irqnum&gt; Add the specified irq list to
the set of banned irqs. irqbalance will not affect the
affinity of any irqs on the banned list, allowing them to be
specified manually. This option is addative and can be
specified multiple times</p>

<p>--banscript=&lt;script&gt; Execute the specified script
for each irq that is discovered, passing the sysfs path to
the associated device as the first argument, and the irq
vector as the second. An exit value of 0 tells irqbalance
that this interrupt should balanced and managed as a normal
irq, while a non-zero exit code indicates this irq should be
ignored by irqbalance completely (see --banirq above). Use
of this script provides users the ability to dynamically
select which irqs get exluded from balancing, and provides
an opportunity for manual affinity setting in one single
code point.</p>

<p>--pid=&lt;file&gt; Have irqbalance write its process id
to the specified file. By default no pidfile is written. The
written pidfile is automati- cally unlinked when irqbalance
exits.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT Same as
--oneshot</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_DEBUG Same as --debug</p>

<p>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS Provides a mask of cpus which
irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to.
This is a hex mask without the leading 0x, on systems with
large numbers of processors each group of eight hex digits
is separated by a comma ,. i.e. export
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=fc0 would prevent irqbalance from
assigning irqs to the 7th-12th cpus (cpu6-cpu11) or export
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=ff000000,00000001 would prevent
irqbal- ance from assigning irqs to the 1st (cpu0) and
57th-64th cpus (cpu56-cpu63).</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGHUP Forces a rescan of the available irqs and
system topology</p>
