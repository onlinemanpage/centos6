<p>aide_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for aide
aide_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME aide_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the aide processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the aide
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The aide processes execute with the aide_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep aide_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The aide_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;aide_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the aide_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/aide</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux aide policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their aide pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for aide:</p>

<p>aide_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a aide_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type aide_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux aide policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their aide processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for aide:</p>

<p>aide_db_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aide_db_t type, if you want to
treat the files as aide database content.</p>

<p>aide_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aide_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the aide_t domain.</p>

<p>aide_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aide_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as aide log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type aide_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>aide_db_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/aide(/.*)?</p>

<p>aide_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/aide(/.*)? /var/log/aide.log.*</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
