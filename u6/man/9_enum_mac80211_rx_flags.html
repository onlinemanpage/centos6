<p>ENUM MAC80211_RX_FLA(9) The basic mac80211 driver inte
ENUM MAC80211_RX_FLA(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_mac80211_rx_flags - receive flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum mac80211_rx_flags { RX_FLAG_MMIC_ERROR,
RX_FLAG_DECRYPTED, RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED,
RX_FLAG_IV_STRIPPED, RX_FLAG_FAILED_FCS_CRC,
RX_FLAG_FAILED_PLCP_CRC, RX_FLAG_MACTIME_START,
RX_FLAG_SHORTPRE, RX_FLAG_HT, RX_FLAG_40MHZ,
RX_FLAG_SHORT_GI, RX_FLAG_NO_SIGNAL_VAL, RX_FLAG_HT_GF,
RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DETAILS, RX_FLAG_AMPDU_REPORT_ZEROLEN,
RX_FLAG_AMPDU_IS_ZEROLEN, RX_FLAG_AMPDU_LAST_KNOWN,
RX_FLAG_AMPDU_IS_LAST, RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_ERROR,
RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_KNOWN, RX_FLAG_MACTIME_END,
RX_FLAG_VHT, RX_FLAG_80MHZ, RX_FLAG_80P80MHZ, RX_FLAG_160MHZ
};</p>

<p>CONSTANTS RX_FLAG_MMIC_ERROR Michael MIC error was
reported on this frame. Use together with
RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_DECRYPTED This frame was decrypted in
hardware.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_MMIC_STRIPPED the Michael MIC is stripped off
this frame, verification has been done by the hardware.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_IV_STRIPPED The IV/ICV are stripped from this
frame. If this flag is set, the stack cannot do any replay
detection hence the driver or hardware will have to do
that.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_FAILED_FCS_CRC Set this flag if the FCS check
failed on the frame.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_FAILED_PLCP_CRC Set this flag if the PCLP check
failed on the frame.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_MACTIME_START The timestamp passed in the RX
status (mactime field) is valid and contains the time the
first symbol of the MPDU was received. This is useful in
monitor mode and for proper IBSS merging.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_SHORTPRE Short preamble was used for this
frame</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_HT HT MCS was used and rate_idx is MCS index</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_40MHZ HT40 (40 MHz) was used</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_SHORT_GI Short guard interval was used</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_NO_SIGNAL_VAL The signal strength value is not
present. Valid only for data frames (mainly A-MPDU)</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_HT_GF This frame was received in a HT-greenfield
transmission, if the driver fills this value it should add
IEEE80211_RADIOTAP_MCS_HAVE_FMT to hw.radiotap_mcs_details
to advertise that fact</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DETAILS A-MPDU details are known, in
particular the reference number (ampdu_reference) must be
populated and be a distinct number for each A-MPDU</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_REPORT_ZEROLEN driver reports 0-length
subframes</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_IS_ZEROLEN This is a zero-length subframe,
for monitoring purposes only</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_LAST_KNOWN last subframe is known, should
be set on all subframes of a single A-MPDU</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_IS_LAST this subframe is the last subframe
of the A-MPDU</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_ERROR A delimiter CRC error has
been detected on this subframe</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_AMPDU_DELIM_CRC_KNOWN The delimiter CRC field is
known (the CRC is stored in the ampdu_delimiter_crc
field)</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_MACTIME_END The timestamp passed in the RX
status (mactime field) is valid and contains the time the
last symbol of the MPDU (including FCS) was received.</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_VHT VHT MCS was used and rate_index is MCS
index</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_80MHZ 80 MHz was used</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_80P80MHZ 80+80 MHz was used</p>

<p>RX_FLAG_160MHZ 160 MHz was used</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These flags are used with the flag member of
struct ieee80211_rx_status.</p>
