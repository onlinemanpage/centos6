<p>svnserve_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
svnservsvnserve_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME svnserve_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the svnserve pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the svnserve
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The svnserve processes execute with the svnserve_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep svnserve_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The svnserve_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,svnserve_exec_t,file_type&quot; file types. The
default entrypoint paths for the svnserve_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/svnserve, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux svnserve policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their svnserve processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
svnserve:</p>

<p>svnserve_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a svnserve_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type svnserve_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux svnserve policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their svnserve processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for svnserve:</p>

<p>svnserve_content_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svnserve_content_t type, if you
want to treat the files as svnserve content.</p>

<p>svnserve_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svnserve_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the svnserve_t domain.</p>

<p>svnserve_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svnserve_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the svnserve_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>svnserve_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svnserve_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the svnserve files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type svnserve_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
