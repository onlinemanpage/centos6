<p>NAME fence_ipmilan - Fence agent for IPMI over LAN</p>

<p>fence_ilo3 - Fence agent for HP iLO2 (symlink)</p>

<p>fence_idrac - Fence agent for Dell iDRAC (symlink)</p>

<p>fence_imm - Fence agent for IBM Integrated Management
Module (symlink)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION fence_ipmilan is an I/O Fencing agent which
can be used with machines controlled by IPMI. This agent
calls support software using ipmitool
(http://ipmitool.sf.net/).</p>

<p>To use fence_ipmilan with HP iLO 3 you have to enable
lanplus option (lanplus / -P) and increase wait after
operation to 4 seconds (power_wait=4 / -T 4)</p>

<p>fence_ipmilan accepts options on the command line as
well as from stdin. Fenced sends parameters through stdin
when it execs the agent. fence_ipmilan can be run by itself
with command line options. This is useful for testing and
for turning outlets on or off from scripts.</p>

<p>PARAMETERS</p>

<p>-A IPMI Lan Auth type (md5, password, or none)</p>

<p>-a IPMI Lan IP to talk to</p>

<p>-p Password (if required) to control power on IPMI
device</p>

<p>-S Script to retrieve password (if required)</p>

<p>-P Use Lanplus</p>

<p>-l Username/Login (if required) to control power on IPMI
device</p>

<p>-o Operation to perform. Valid operations: on, off,
reboot, status, list, diag, monitor or metadata (Default
Value: reboot)</p>

<p>-t Timeout (sec) for IPMI operation</p>

<p>-C Ciphersuite to use (same as ipmitool -C
parameter)</p>

<p>-M Method to fence (onoff or cycle) (Default Value:
onoff)</p>

<p>-T Wait X seconds after on/off operation (Default Value:
2)</p>

<p>-f Wait X seconds before fencing is started</p>

<p>-L Privilege level on IPMI device</p>

<p>-v Verbose mode</p>

<p>ACTIONS</p>

<p>on Power on machine.</p>

<p>off Power off machine.</p>

<p>reboot Reboot machine.</p>

<p>status This returns the status of the plug/virtual
