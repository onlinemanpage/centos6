<p>NAME sssd - System Security Services Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sssd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms.
It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a
pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different
account sources as well as D-Bus interface. It is also the
basis to provide client auditing and policy services for
projects like FreeIPA. It provides a more robust database to
store local users as well as extended user data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d,--debug-level LEVEL Bit mask that indicates
which debug levels will be visible. 0x0010 is the default
value as well as the lowest allowed value, 0xFFF0 is the
most verbose mode. This setting overrides the settings from
config file.</p>

<p>Currently supported debug levels:</p>

<p>0x0010: Fatal failures. Anything that would prevent SSSD
from starting up or causes it to cease running.</p>

<p>0x0020: Critical failures. An error that doesn&acute;t
kill the SSSD, but one that indicates that at least one
major feature is not going to work properly.</p>

<p>0x0040: Serious failures. An error announcing that a
particular request or operation has failed.</p>

<p>0x0080: Minor failures. These are the errors that would
percolate down to cause the operation failure of 2.</p>

<p>0x0100: Configuration settings.</p>

<p>0x0200: Function data.</p>

<p>0x0400: Trace messages for operation functions.</p>

<p>0x1000: Trace messages for internal control
functions.</p>

<p>0x2000: Contents of function-internal variables that may
be interesting.</p>

<p>0x4000: Extremely low-level tracing information.</p>

<p>To log required debug levels, simply add their numbers
together as shown in following examples:</p>

<p>Example: To log fatal failures, critical failures,
serious failures and function data use 0x0270.</p>

<p>Example: To log fatal failures, configuration settings,
function data, trace messages for internal control functions
use 0x1310.</p>

<p>Note: This is new format of debug levels introduced in
1.7.0. Older format (numbers from 0-10) is compatible but
deprecated.</p>

<p>--debug-timestamps=mode</p>

<p>1: Add a timestamp to the debug messages</p>

<p>0: Disable timestamp in the debug messages</p>

<p>Default: 1</p>

<p>--debug-microseconds=mode</p>

<p>1: Add microseconds to the timestamp in debug
messages</p>

<p>0: Disable microseconds in timestamp</p>

<p>Default: 0</p>

<p>-f,--debug-to-files Send the debug output to files
instead of stderr. By default, the log files are stored in
/var/log/sssd and there are separate log files for every
SSSD service and domain.</p>

<p>-D,--daemon Become a daemon after starting up.</p>

<p>-i,--interactive Run in the foreground, don&acute;t
become a daemon.</p>

<p>-c,--config Specify a non-default config file. The
default is /etc/sssd/sssd.conf. For reference on the config
file syntax and options, consult the sssd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>-h,--help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>--version Print version number and exit.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGTERM/SIGINT Informs the SSSD to gracefully
terminate all of its child processes and then shut down the
monitor.</p>

<p>SIGHUP Tells the SSSD to stop writing to its current
debug file descriptors and to close and reopen them. This is
meant to facilitate log rolling with programs like
logrotate.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Tells the SSSD to simulate offline operation for
one minute. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 Tells the SSSD to go online immediately. This is
mostly useful for testing purposes.</p>
