<p>run_selinux(8) run SELinux Policy documentation
run_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME run_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the run processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. run policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run run with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to run unconfined script, you
must turn on the samba_run_unconfined boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_run_unconfined 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux run policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their run processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for run:</p>

<p>run_init_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the run_init_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the run_init_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux run policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their run processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for run:</p>

<p>run_init_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
