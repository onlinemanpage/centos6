<p>virtd_selinux(8) virtd SELinux Policy documentation
virtd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME virtd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the virtd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. virtd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run virtd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to manage nfs file, you must
turn on the virt_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to use serial/parallell
communication port, you must turn on the virt_use_comm
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_comm 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virtual machine to interact with
the xserve, you must turn on the virt_use_xserver
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_xserver 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to manage device
configuration, (pci, you must turn on the virt_use_sysfs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_sysfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact
with the san- loc, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to use usb device, you must
turn on the virt_use_usb boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_usb 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to read fuse file, you must
turn on the virt_use_fusefs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_fusefs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to manage cifs file, you must
turn on the virt_use_samba boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_samba 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virt_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_cache_t type, if you want to
store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/oz(/.*)?, /var/cache/libvirt</p>

<p>virt_content_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_content_t type, if you want to
treat the files as virt content.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/oz/isos(/.*)?,
/var/lib/libvirt/boot(/.*)?, /var/lib/lib-
virt/isos(/.*)?</p>

<p>virt_etc_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_etc_rw_t type, if you want to
treat the files as virt etc read/write content.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/libvirt/.*/.*, /etc/xen/.*/.*,
/etc/xen/[^/]*, /etc/lib- virt/[^/]*</p>

<p>virt_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_etc_t type, if you want to
store virt files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/libvirt/[^/]*, /etc/libvirt, /etc/xen/[^/]*,
/etc/xen</p>

<p>virt_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_home_t type, if you want to
store virt files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>virt_image_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_image_t type, if you want to
treat the files as virt image data.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/imagefactory/images(/.*)?,
/var/lib/libvirt/images(/.*)?</p>

<p>virt_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as virt log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>virt_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_tmp_t type, if you want to
store virt tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>virt_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the virt files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/oz(/.*)?, /var/lib/libvirt(/.*)?</p>

<p>virt_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virt_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the virt files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/vdsm(/.*)?, /var/run/libvirt(/.*)?</p>

<p>virtd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the virtd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/imgfac.py, /usr/bin/imagefactory,
/usr/sbin/condor_vm- gahp, /usr/sbin/libvirtd,
/usr/share/vdsm/vdsm</p>

<p>virtd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the virtd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>virtd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the virtd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virt_migration_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>virt_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their virtd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for virtd:</p>

<p>virtd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
