<p>varnishd_selinux(8) varnishd SELinux Policy
documentation varnishd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME varnishd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the varnishd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures varnishd (Varnishd
http accelerator daemon) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. var- nishd policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run varnishd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow varnishd to connect to all ports,
not just HTTP, you must turn on the varnishd_connect_any
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P varnishd_connect_any 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux varnishd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their varnishd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for varnishd:</p>

<p>varnishd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_etc_t type, if you want to
store varnishd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>varnishd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the varnishd_t domain.</p>

<p>varnishd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the varnishd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>varnishd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store varnishd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>varnishd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the varnishd files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>varnishd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the varnishd_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the varnishd files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux varnishd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their varnishd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for varnishd:</p>

<p>varnishd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux varnishd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their varnishd processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
varnishd:</p>

<p>varnishd_t, varnishlog_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
