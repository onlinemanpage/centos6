<p>STAP-AUTHORIZE-SERVER-CERT(8)
STAP-AUTHORIZE-SERVER-CERT(8)</p>

<p>NAME stap-authorize-server-cert - systemtap server
authorization utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS stap-authorize-server-cert CERTFILE [ DIRNAME
]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION stap-authorize-server-cert is deprecated and
will be removed in release 1.5. Please use stap
--trust-servers . See stap(1) for more informa- tion.</p>

<p>A systemtap compile server listens for connections from
clients on a secure SSL network port and accepts requests to
run the stap front end. Each server advertises its presence
and configuration on the local net- work using mDNS (avahi)
allowing for automatic detection by clients.</p>

<p>The security of the SSL network connection between the
client and server depends on the proper management of server
certificates.</p>

<p>The trustworthiness of a given systemtap server can not
be determined automatically without a trusted certificate
authority issuing systemtap server certificates. This is not
practical in everyday use and so, clients must authenticate
servers against their own database of trusted server
certificates. In this context, establishing a given server
as trusted by a given client means adding that
server&rsquo;s certificate to the client&rsquo;s database of
trusted servers.</p>

<p>The stap-authorize-server-cert program adds the given
server certifi- cate to the given client-side certificate
database, making that server a trusted server for clients
using that database.</p>

<p>ARGUMENTS The stap-authorize-server-cert program accepts
two arguments:</p>

<p>CERTFILE This is the name of the file containing the
certificate of the new trusted server. This is the file
named stap.cert which can be found in the server&rsquo;s
certificate database. On the server host, for servers
started by the stap-server service, this database can be
found in /var/lib/stap-server/.system- tap/ssl/server/.
Otherwise, this database can be found in $SYS-
TEMTAP_DIR/ssl/server/. If SYSTEMTAP_DIR is not set, then
the database can be found in
$HOME/.systemtap/ssl/server/.</p>

<p>DIRNAME This optional argument is the name of the
directory containing the client-side certificate database to
which the certificate is to be added. If not specified, the
default is $SYSTEM- TAP_DIR/ssl/client/. If SYSTEMTAP_DIR is
not set, then the database can be found in
$HOME/.systemtap/ssl/client/.</p>

<p>SAFETY AND SECURITY Systemtap is an administrative tool.
It exposes kernel internal data structures and potentially
private user information. See the stap(1) manual page for
additional information on safety and security.</p>

<p>The systemtap server and its related utilities use the
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) as implemented by Network Security
Services (NSS) for net- work security. The NSS tool certutil
is used for the generation of cer- tificates. The related
certificate databases must be protected in order to maintain
the security of the system. Use of the utilities provided
will help to ensure that the proper protection is
maintained. The sys- temtap client will check for proper
access permissions before making use of any certificate
database.</p>

<p>FILES
/var/lib/stap-server/.systemtap/ssl/server/stap.cert Server
certificate for servers started by the stap-server ser-
vice.</p>

<p>$SYSTEMTAP_DIR/ssl/server/stap.cert Server certificate
for servers started by other users.</p>

<p>$SYSTEMTAP_DIR/ssl/client/ User&rsquo;s private client
side certificate database.</p>
