<p>pcscd_selinux(8) pcscd SELinux Policy documentation
pcscd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME pcscd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the pcscd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures pcscd (PCSC smart card
service) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux pcscd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pcscd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for pcscd:</p>

<p>pcscd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pcscd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the pcscd_t domain.</p>

<p>pcscd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pcscd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the pcscd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/pcscd.pid, /var/run/pcscd.comm,
/var/run/pcscd.pub, /var/run/pcscd.events(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux pcscd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their pcscd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for pcscd:</p>

<p>pcscd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
