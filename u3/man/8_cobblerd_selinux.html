<p>cobblerd_selinux(8) cobblerd SELinux Policy
documentation cobblerd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME cobblerd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the cobblerd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. cob- blerd policy is
extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you
to manipulate the policy and run cobblerd with the tightest
access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to connect to the network
using TCP, you must turn on the cobbler_can_network_connect
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access nfs file systems,
you must turn on the cobbler_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow HTTPD scripts and modules to
connect to cobbler over the network, you must turn on the
httpd_can_network_connect_cob- bler boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access cifs file
systems, you must turn on the cobbler_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow cobblerd servers to read the /var/cobblerd
directory by adding the public_content_t file type to the
directory and by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/cobblerd(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/cobblerd</p>

<p>Allow cobblerd servers to read and write
/var/tmp/incoming by adding the public_content_rw_t type to
the directory and by restoring the file type. This also
requires the allow_cobblerd_anon_write boolean to be
set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/cobblerd/incom- ing(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R
-v /var/cobblerd/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to modify public files used
for public file transfer services., you must turn on the
cobbler_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cobblerd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobbler_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobbler_etc_t type, if you want to
store cobbler files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>cobbler_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobbler_tmp_t type, if you want to
store cobbler temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>cobbler_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobbler_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the cobbler files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/cobbler(/.*)?,
/var/www/cobbler/images(/.*)?,
/var/www/cobbler/repo_mirror(/.*)?, /var/lib/tftp-
boot/pxelinux.cfg(/.*)?, /var/lib/tftpboot/memdisk,
/var/lib/tftp- boot/s390x(/.*)?,
/var/lib/tftpboot/images(/.*)?, /var/www/cob-
bler/links(/.*)?, /var/lib/tftpboot/menu.c32, /var/lib/tftp-
boot/yaboot, /var/www/cobbler/localmirror(/.*)?,
/var/www/cob- bler/ks_mirror(/.*)?,
/var/lib/tftpboot/grub(/.*)?, /var/www/cob- bler/pub(/.*)?,
/var/lib/tftpboot/ppc(/.*)?, /var/lib/tftp- boot/pxelinux.0,
/var/lib/tftpboot/etc(/.*)?, /var/www/cob-
bler/rendered(/.*)?</p>

<p>cobbler_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobbler_var_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as cobbler var log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>cobblerd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobblerd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the cobblerd_t domain.</p>

<p>cobblerd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cobblerd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the cobblerd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cobblerd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobbler_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cobblerd processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cobblerd:</p>

<p>cobblerd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
