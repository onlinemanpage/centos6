<p>puppet_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
puppet puppet_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME puppet_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the puppet pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the puppet
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The puppet processes execute with the puppet_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep puppet_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The puppet_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,pup-
pet_exec_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the puppet_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/puppetd, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux puppet policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their puppet processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for puppet:</p>

<p>puppet_t, puppetmaster_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a puppet_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type puppet_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. puppet policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run puppet with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Puppet master to use connect to
mysql and post- gresql database, you must turn on the
puppetmaster_use_db boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P puppetmaster_use_db 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Puppet client to manage all file
types, you must turn on the puppet_manage_all_files
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P puppet_manage_all_files 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Puppet master to use connect to
mysql and post- gresql database, you must turn on the
puppetmaster_use_db boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P puppetmaster_use_db 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Puppet client to manage all file
types, you must turn on the puppet_manage_all_files
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P puppet_manage_all_files 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux puppet policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their puppet processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for puppet:</p>

<p>puppet_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_etc_t type, if you want to
store puppet files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>puppet_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the puppet_t domain.</p>

<p>puppet_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the puppet_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>puppet_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as puppet log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>puppet_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_tmp_t type, if you want to
store puppet temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>puppet_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the puppet files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>puppet_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppet_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the puppet files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>puppetmaster_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the puppetmaster_t
domain.</p>

<p>puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
puppetmaster_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>puppetmaster_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the puppetmaster_tmp_t type, if you
want to store pup- petmaster temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux puppet policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their puppet processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for puppet:</p>

<p>puppet_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8140</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type puppet_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
