<p>PMDADBPING(1) Performance Co-Pilot PMDADBPING(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmdadbping - database response time and
availability PMDA</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Simple database response time measurement
PMDA. dbprobe.pl(1) should be configured to use the type of
DBI appropriate for your database, which includes: RDBMS
flavour, user/password, delay between &quot;ping&quot;
requests, and the SQL statement to use. pmdadbping runs
dbprobe.pl(1), and exports the performance measurements it
makes available as PCP metrics.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION Configure dbprobe.pl(1) - it uses a
configuration file from (in this order):</p>

<p>&middot; /etc/pcpdbi.conf</p>

<p>&middot; $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf</p>

<p>This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for
the settings listed at the start of dbprobe.pl, namely:</p>

<p>&middot; database name (see DBI(3) for details)</p>

<p>&middot; database user name</p>

<p>&middot; database pass word</p>

<p>&middot; SQL statement to measure (probe)</p>

<p>&middot; delay between probes</p>

<p>Once this is setup, you can access the names and values
for the dbping performance metrics by doing the following as
root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdadbping is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/probes.stp probe
configuration file for stap(1), run by pmdadbping</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Install installation script for
the pmdadbping agent</p>

<p>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Remove undo installation script
for the pmdadbping agent</p>

<p>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dbping.log default log file for error
messages from pmdadbping</p>

<p>SEE ALSO pmcd(1), dbprobe.pl(1) and DBI(3).</p>
