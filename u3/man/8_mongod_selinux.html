<p>mongod_selinux(8) mongod SELinux Policy documentation
mongod_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mongod_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mongod pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mongod policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mongod processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mongod:</p>

<p>mongod_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mongod_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/mongod,
/usr/share/aeolus-conductor/dbomatic/dbomatic</p>

<p>mongod_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the mongod_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>mongod_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as mongod log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>mongod_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_tmp_t type, if you want to
store mongod temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>mongod_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the mongod files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>mongod_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mongod_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the mongod files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/mongodb(/.*)?,
/var/run/aeolus/dbomatic.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux mongod policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mongod processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for mongod:</p>

<p>mongod_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mongod policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their mongod processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mongod:</p>

<p>mongod_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
