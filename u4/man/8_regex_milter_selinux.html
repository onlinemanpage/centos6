<p>regex_milter_seliSELinux Policy documentation for
regexregex_milter_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME regex_milter_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the regex_milter processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
regex_milter processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The regex_milter processes execute with the
regex_milter_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these
processes running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep regex_milter_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The regex_milter_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;regex_mil- ter_exec_t&quot; file type.
The default entrypoint paths for the regex_mil- ter_t domain
are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/milter-regex</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux regex_milter policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their regex_milter processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
regex_milter:</p>

<p>regex_milter_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a regex_milter_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type regex_milter_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux regex_milter policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their regex_milter processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
regex_milter:</p>

<p>regex_milter_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the regex_milter_data_t type, if you
want to treat the files as regex milter content.</p>

<p>regex_milter_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the regex_milter_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the regex_milter_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type regex_milter_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>regex_milter_data_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/milter-regex(/.*)?</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
