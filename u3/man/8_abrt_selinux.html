<p>abrt_selinux(8) abrt SELinux Policy documentation
abrt_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME abrt_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the abrt processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures abrt (ABRT - automated
bug-reporting tool) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. abrt policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run abrt with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow ABRT to run in abrt_handle_event_t
domain to han- dle ABRT event script, you must turn on the
abrt_handle_event boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P abrt_handle_event 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow abrt servers to read the /var/abrt directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/abrt(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/abrt</p>

<p>Allow abrt servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming
by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and
by restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_abrt_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/abrt/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/abrt/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow ABRT to modify public files used
for public file transfer services., you must turn on the
abrt_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P abrt_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux abrt policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their abrt processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for abrt:</p>

<p>abrt_dump_oops_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_dump_oops_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the abrt_dump_oops_t
domain.</p>

<p>abrt_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_etc_t type, if you want to
store abrt files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>abrt_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the abrt_t domain.</p>

<p>abrt_handle_event_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_handle_event_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
abrt_handle_event_t domain.</p>

<p>abrt_helper_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_helper_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the abrt_helper_t
domain.</p>

<p>abrt_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the abrt_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>abrt_retrace_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_retrace_cache_t type, if you
want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/retrace-server(/.*)?,
/var/cache/abrt-retrace(/.*)?</p>

<p>abrt_retrace_coredump_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_retrace_coredump_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
abrt_retrace_coredump_t domain.</p>

<p>abrt_retrace_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_retrace_spool_t type, if you
want to store the abrt retrace files under the /var/spool
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/spool/retrace-server(/.*)?,
/var/spool/abrt-retrace(/.*)?</p>

<p>abrt_retrace_worker_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_retrace_worker_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
abrt_retrace_worker_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/retrace-server-worker,
/usr/bin/abrt-retrace-worker</p>

<p>abrt_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_tmp_t type, if you want to
store abrt tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>abrt_var_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_var_cache_t type, if you want
to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/abrt(/.*)?, /var/cache/abrt-di(/.*)?,
/var/spool/abrt(/.*)?</p>

<p>abrt_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_var_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as abrt var log data, usually stored under
the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>abrt_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the abrt files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/abrtd?.socket, /var/run/abrtd?.lock,
/var/run/abrt(/.*)?, /var/run/abrt.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux abrt policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their abrt pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for abrt:</p>

<p>abrt_handle_event_t, abrt_helper_t,
abrt_retrace_coredump_t, abrt_t, abrt_retrace_worker_t,
abrt_dump_oops_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
