IEEE80211_STA_I(9)</p>

<p>NAME enum_ieee80211_sta_info_flags - Stations flags</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS enum ieee80211_sta_info_flags { WLAN_STA_AUTH,
WLAN_STA_ASSOC, WLAN_STA_PS_STA, WLAN_STA_AUTHORIZED,
WLAN_STA_SHORT_PREAMBLE, WLAN_STA_ASSOC_AP, WLAN_STA_WME,
WLAN_STA_WDS, WLAN_STA_CLEAR_PS_FILT, WLAN_STA_MFP,
WLAN_STA_SUSPEND, WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER, WLAN_STA_PSPOLL };</p>

<p>CONSTANTS WLAN_STA_AUTH Station is authenticated.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_ASSOC Station is associated.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PS_STA Station is in power-save mode</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_AUTHORIZED Station is authorized to
send/receive traffic. This bit is always checked so needs to
be enabled for all stations when virtual port control is not
in use.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_SHORT_PREAMBLE Station is capable of receiving
short-preamble frames.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_ASSOC_AP We&acute;re associated to that
station, it is an AP.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_WME Station is a QoS-STA.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_WDS Station is one of our WDS peers.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_CLEAR_PS_FILT Clear PS filter in hardware
(using the IEEE80211_TX_CTL_CLEAR_PS_FILT control flag) when
the next frame to this station is transmitted.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_MFP Management frame protection is used with
this STA.</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_SUSPEND Set/cleared during a suspend/resume
cycle. Used to deny ADDBA requests (both TX and RX).</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER driver requires keeping this station
in power-save mode logically to flush frames that might
still be in the queues</p>

<p>WLAN_STA_PSPOLL Station sent PS-poll while driver was
keeping station in power-save mode, reply when the driver
unblocks.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION These flags are used with struct
sta_info&acute;s flags member.</p>
