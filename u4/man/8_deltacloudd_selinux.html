<p>deltacloudd_selinSELinux Policy documentation for
deltacdeltacloudd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME deltacloudd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the delta- cloudd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
deltacloudd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The deltacloudd processes execute with the deltacloudd_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep deltacloudd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The deltacloudd_t SELinux type can be
entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,delta-
cloudd_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the
deltacloudd_t domain are the follow- ing:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/deltacloudd, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux deltacloudd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their deltacloudd processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
deltacloudd:</p>

<p>deltacloudd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a deltacloudd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type deltacloudd_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux deltacloudd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their deltacloudd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
deltacloudd:</p>

<p>deltacloudd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the deltacloudd_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the deltacloudd_t
domain.</p>

<p>deltacloudd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the deltacloudd_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as deltacloudd log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>deltacloudd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the deltacloudd_tmp_t type, if you want
to store deltacloudd temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type deltacloudd_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
