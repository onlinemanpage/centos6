<p>lpd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for lpd
lpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME lpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the lpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lpd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The lpd processes execute with the lpd_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep lpd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The lpd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;lpd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default entrypoint
paths for the lpd_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/lpd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux lpd policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their lpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for lpd:</p>

<p>lpd_t, lpr_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a lpd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type lpd_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. lpd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run lpd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to use lpd server instead of cups, you must
turn on the use_lpd_server boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_lpd_server 1</p>

<p>If you want to use lpd server instead of cups, you must
turn on the use_lpd_server boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_lpd_server 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux lpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for lpd:</p>

<p>lpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the lpd_t domain.</p>

<p>lpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store lpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>lpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lpd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the lpd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type lpd_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>lpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>lpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/lprng(/.*)?</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>print_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/lpd(/.*)? /var/spool/cups(/.*)?
/var/spool/cups-pdf(/.*)?</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
