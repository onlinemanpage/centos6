<p>innd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for innd
innd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME innd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the innd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the innd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The innd processes execute with the innd_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep innd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The innd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;innd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the innd_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their innd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for innd:</p>

<p>innd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a innd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type innd_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for innd:</p>

<p>innd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_etc_t type, if you want to
store innd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>innd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the innd_t domain.</p>

<p>innd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the innd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>innd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as innd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>innd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the innd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>innd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the innd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the innd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for innd:</p>

<p>innd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 119</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type innd_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>innd_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/news(/.*)?</p>

<p>innd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/news(/.*)?</p>

<p>innd_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/innd(/.*)? /var/run/news(/.*)?</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>news_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/news(/.*)?</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
