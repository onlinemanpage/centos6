<p>sendmail_selinux(8) sendmail SELinux Policy
documentation sendmail_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sendmail_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the sendmail pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures sendmail (Policy for
sendmail) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. send- mail policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run sendmail with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to send mai, you must
turn on the httpd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mai, you
must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sendmail policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their sendmail processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sendmail:</p>

<p>sendmail_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the sendmail_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/ssmtp, /usr/lib(64)?/sendmail,
/usr/sbin/rmail, /usr/bin/esmtp, /var/qmail/bin/sendmail,
/usr/sbin/sendmail.post- fix, /usr/lib/courier/bin/sendmail,
/bin/mail(x)?, /usr/sbin/send- mail(.sendmail)?</p>

<p>sendmail_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the sendmail_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>sendmail_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_keytab_t type, if you want
to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>sendmail_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as sendmail log data, usually stored under
the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/sendmail.st, /var/log/mail(/.*)?</p>

<p>sendmail_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_tmp_t type, if you want to
store sendmail temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>sendmail_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the sendmail files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/sendmail.pid, /var/run/sm-client.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sendmail policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sendmail processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
sendmail:</p>

<p>sendmail_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
