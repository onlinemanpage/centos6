<p>NAME openshift_cgroup_read_selinux - Security Enhanced
Linux Policy for the openshift_cgroup_read processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
openshift_cgroup_read processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>The openshift_cgroup_read processes execute with the
open- shift_cgroup_read_t SELinux type. You can check if you
have these pro- cesses running by executing the ps command
with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep openshift_cgroup_read_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The openshift_cgroup_read_t SELinux type can
be entered via the &quot;open-
shift_cgroup_read_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the openshift_cgroup_read_t domain are
the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/s?bin/(oo|rhc)-cgroup-read</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux openshift_cgroup_read policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their openshift_cgroup_read
processes in as secure a method as possi- ble.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
openshift_cgroup_read:</p>

<p>openshift_cgroup_read_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a openshift_cgroup_read_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type
openshift_cgroup_read_t permis- sive. Permissive process
types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will
still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux openshift_cgroup_read policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their openshift_cgroup_read
processes in as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
openshift_cgroup_read:</p>

<p>openshift_cgroup_read_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the openshift_cgroup_read_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
openshift_cgroup_read_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
openshift_cgroup_read_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
