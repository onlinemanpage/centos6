<p>hald_selinux(8) hald SELinux Policy documentation
hald_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME hald_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the hald processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux hald policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their hald processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for hald:</p>

<p>hald_acl_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_acl_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the hald_acl_t domain.</p>

<p>hald_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_cache_t type, if you want to
store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>hald_dccm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_dccm_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the hald_dccm_t domain.</p>

<p>hald_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the hald_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/hal/device.d/printer_remove.hal,
/usr/libexec/hal-hotplug- map,
/etc/hal/capability.d/printer_update.hal, /usr/sbin/hald</p>

<p>hald_keymap_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_keymap_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the hald_keymap_t
domain.</p>

<p>hald_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as hald log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/pm(/.*)?, /var/log/pm-.*.log</p>

<p>hald_mac_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_mac_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the hald_mac_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/radeontool,
/usr/libexec/hald-addon-macbook-backlight,
/usr/libexec/hald-addon-macbookpro-backlight</p>

<p>hald_sonypic_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_sonypic_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the hald_sonypic_t
domain.</p>

<p>hald_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_tmp_t type, if you want to
store hald tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>hald_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the hald files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>hald_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the hald files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/haldaemon.pid, /var/run/hald(/.*)?,
/var/run/synce.*, /var/run/vbe.*, /var/run/pm-utils(/.*)?,
/var/run/pm(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux hald policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their hald pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for hald:</p>

<p>hald_mac_t, hald_dccm_t, hald_sonypic_t, hald_acl_t,
hald_t, hald_keymap_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
