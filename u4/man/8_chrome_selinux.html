<p>chrome_selinux(8) chrome SELinux Policy documentation
chrome_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME chrome_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the chrome pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures chrome (policy for
chrome) processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux chrome policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their chrome processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for chrome:</p>

<p>chrome_sandbox_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the chrome_sandbox_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the chrome_sandbox_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox,
/usr/lib(64)?/chromium- browser/chrome-sandbox</p>

<p>chrome_sandbox_nacl_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the chrome_sandbox_nacl_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
chrome_sandbox_nacl_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /opt/google/chrome/nacl_helper_bootstrap,
/usr/lib/chromium- browser/nacl_helper_bootstrap</p>

<p>chrome_sandbox_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the chrome_sandbox_tmp_t type, if you
want to store chrome sandbox temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>chrome_sandbox_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the chrome_sandbox_tmpfs_t type, if you
want to store chrome sandbox files on a tmpfs file
system.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux chrome policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their chrome processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for chrome:</p>

<p>chrome_sandbox_t, chrome_sandbox_nacl_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
