<p>denyhosts_selinux(8)denyhosts SELinux Policy
documentationdenyhosts_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME denyhosts_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the denyhosts processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures denyhosts (Deny Hosts)
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux denyhosts policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their denyhosts processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for denyhosts:</p>

<p>denyhosts_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the denyhosts_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the denyhosts_t domain.</p>

<p>denyhosts_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the denyhosts_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
denyhosts_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>denyhosts_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the denyhosts_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the denyhosts files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>denyhosts_var_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the denyhosts_var_lock_t type, if you
want to treat the files as denyhosts var lock data, stored
under the /var/lock direc- tory</p>

<p>denyhosts_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the denyhosts_var_log_t type, if you
want to treat the data as denyhosts var log data, usually
stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux denyhosts policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their deny- hosts processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
denyhosts:</p>

<p>denyhosts_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
