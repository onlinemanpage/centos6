<p>quota_selinux(8) quota SELinux Policy documentation
quota_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME quota_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the quota processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures quota (File system
quota management) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux quota policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their quota processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for quota:</p>

<p>quota_db_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quota_db_t type, if you want to
treat the files as quota database content.</p>

<p>Paths: /boot/a?quota.(user|group),
/etc/a?quota.(user|group), /a?quota.(user|group),
/var/a?quota.(user|group),
/var/spool/(.*/)?a?quota.(user|group)</p>

<p>quota_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quota_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the quota_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/convertquota, /sbin/quota(check|on)</p>

<p>quota_flag_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quota_flag_t type, if you want to
treat the files as quota flag data.</p>

<p>quota_nld_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quota_nld_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the quota_nld_t domain.</p>

<p>quota_nld_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the quota_nld_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the quota nld files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux quota policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their quota pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for quota:</p>

<p>quota_t, quota_nld_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
