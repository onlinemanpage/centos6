<p>PERF-LIST(1) PERF-LIST(1)</p>

<p>NAME perf-list - List all symbolic event types</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS perf list</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This command displays the symbolic event
types which can be selected in the various perf commands
with the -e option.</p>

<p>EVENT MODIFIERS Events can optionally have a modifer by
appending a colon and one or more modifiers. Modifiers allow
the user to restrict when events are counted with u for
user-space, k for kernel, h for hypervisor.</p>

<p>The p modifier can be used for specifying how precise
the instruction address should be. The p modifier is
currently only implemented for Intel PEBS and can be
specified multiple times: 0 - SAMPLE_IP can have arbitrary
skid 1 - SAMPLE_IP must have constant skid 2 - SAMPLE_IP
requested to have 0 skid 3 - SAMPLE_IP must have 0 skid</p>

<p>The PEBS implementation now supports up to 2.</p>

<p>RAW HARDWARE EVENT DESCRIPTOR Even when an event is not
available in a symbolic form within perf right now, it can
be encoded in a per processor specific way.</p>

<p>For instance For x86 CPUs NNN represents the raw
register encoding with the layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs
(see [Intel&reg; 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software
Developers Manual Volume 3B: System Programming Guide]
Figure 30-1 Layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs) or AMD s
PerfEvtSeln (see [AMD64 Architecture Programmer s Manual
Volume 2: System Programming], Page 344, Figure 13-7
Performance Event-Select Register (PerfEvtSeln)).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>If the Intel docs for a QM720 Core i7 describe an event
as:</p>

<p>Event Umask Event Mask Num. Value Mnemonic Description
Comment</p>

<p>A8H 01H LSD.UOPS Counts the number of micro-ops Use
cmask=1 and delivered by loop stream detector invert to
count cycles</p>

<p>raw encoding of 0x1A8 can be used:</p>

<p>perf stat -e r1a8 -a sleep 1 perf record -e r1a8 ...</p>

<p>You should refer to the processor specific documentation
for getting these details. Some of them are referenced in
the SEE ALSO section below.</p>

<p>OPTIONS None</p>
