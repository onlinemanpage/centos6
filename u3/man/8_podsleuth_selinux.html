documentationpodsleuth_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME podsleuth_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the podsleuth processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures podsleuth (Podsleuth
is a tool to get information about an Apple (TM) iPod (TM))
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux podsleuth policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their podsleuth processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for podsleuth:</p>

<p>podsleuth_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the podsleuth_cache_t type, if you want
to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>podsleuth_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the podsleuth_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the podsleuth_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/podsleuth,
/usr/libexec/hal-podsleuth</p>

<p>podsleuth_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the podsleuth_tmp_t type, if you want
to store pod- sleuth temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>podsleuth_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the podsleuth_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store pod- sleuth files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux podsleuth policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pod- sleuth processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
podsleuth:</p>

<p>podsleuth_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
