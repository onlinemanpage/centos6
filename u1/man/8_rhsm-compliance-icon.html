<p>rhsm-compliance-icon(8) Subscription Compliance Daemon
rhsm-compliance-icon(8)</p>

<p>NAME rhsm-compliance-icon - Periodically checks
installed products against active subscriptions to check for
compliance.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rhsm-compliance-icon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Red Hat provides content updates and support
by issuing subscriptions for its products. These
subscriptions are allocated to systems (machines) and apply
to the installed software products.</p>

<p>On X systems (so, systems with a GUI interface), a
compliance daemon runs every 4 hours to check the currently
installed software against the allocated subscriptions. If
software is installed with expired sub- scriptions or no
available subscription, then the daemon triggers an icon and
warning message to display in the start menu bar.</p>

<p>rhsm-compliance-icon only runs on X-based systems.
Servers which do not have a GUI inter- face do not run or
require the rhsm-compliance-icon daemon.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c, --check-period Sets the interval to use
between checks for compliance. The value is in seconds.</p>

<p>-f, --force-icon=TYPE Manually displays the given type
of icon in the start menu. The TYPE can be warning or
expired and uses a different icon for each type of
message.</p>

<p>-d, --debug Shows debug messages for the daemon.</p>

<p>USAGE There are two reasons to invoke
rhsm-compliance-icon manually:</p>

<p>* To run the daemon on a new schedule (immediately or
with a different frequency)</p>

<p>* To view the compliance icons or messages regardless of
the compliance state of the machine</p>

<p>Since X runs the daemon automatically and on schedule,
it is not neces- sary normally to run the compliance daemon.
Administrators can run it to view any immediate changes to
the compliance of the system. For example:
rhsm-compliance-icon --check-period 120</p>

<p>If you just want to know what the different compliance
messages look like, then use the --force-icon option.</p>

<p>rhsm-compliance-icon --force-icon=warning</p>

<p>rhsm-compliance-icon --force-icon=expired</p>

<p>BUGS This process is part of the subscription management
system for Red Hat systems. To file bugs against this
process, go to https://bugzilla.red- hat.com/ and select Red
Hat &gt; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 &gt; subscrip-
