<p>wine_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for wine
wine_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME wine_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the wine processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wine
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The wine processes execute with the wine_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep wine_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The wine_t SELinux type can be entered via
the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,wine_exec_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type&quot; file types. The default entrypoint
paths for the wine_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/wine.*,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/wdi,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/wine.*,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/msiexec,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/notepad,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/progman,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/regedit,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/regsvr32,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/Picasa3/.*exe,
/opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/uninstaller,
/opt/cxoffice/bin/wine.*, /opt/picasa/wine/bin/wine.*,
/usr/bin/msiexec, /usr/bin/notepad, /usr/bin/regedit,
/usr/bin/regsvr32, /usr/bin/uninstaller,
/home/[^/]*/cxoffice/bin/wine.+, all files on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux wine policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their wine pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for wine:</p>

<p>wine_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a wine_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type wine_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. wine policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run wine with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors, you must
turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1</p>

<p>If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors, you must
turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux wine policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their wine processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for wine:</p>

<p>wine_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the wine_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the wine_t domain.</p>

<p>wine_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the wine_tmp_t type, if you want to
store wine tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type wine_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
