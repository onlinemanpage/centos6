<p>NAME telepathy_gabble_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the telepathy_gabble processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
telepathy_gabble processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The telepathy_gabble processes execute with the
telepathy_gabble_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep telepathy_gabble_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The telepathy_gabble_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;telepa- thy_gabble_exec_t&quot; file
type. The default entrypoint paths for the
telepathy_gabble_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux telepathy_gabble policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their telepathy_gabble processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
telepathy_gabble:</p>

<p>telepathy_gabble_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a telepathy_gabble_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type telepathy_gabble_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux telepathy_gabble policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their telepathy_gabble
processes in as secure a method as possi- ble.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
telepathy_gabble:</p>

<p>telepathy_gabble_cache_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the telepathy_gabble_cache_home_t type,
if you want to store telepathy gabble cache files in the
users home directory.</p>

<p>telepathy_gabble_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the telepathy_gabble_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
telepathy_gabble_t domain.</p>

<p>telepathy_gabble_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the telepathy_gabble_tmp_t type, if you
want to store telepathy gabble temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
telepathy_gabble_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>telepathy_gabble_cache_home_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
