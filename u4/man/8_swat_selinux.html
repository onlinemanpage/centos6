<p>swat_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for swat
swat_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME swat_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the swat processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the swat
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The swat processes execute with the swat_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep swat_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The swat_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;swat_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the swat_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/swat</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux swat policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their swat pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for swat:</p>

<p>swat_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a swat_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type swat_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux swat policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their swat processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for swat:</p>

<p>swat_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the swat_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the swat_t domain.</p>

<p>swat_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the swat_tmp_t type, if you want to
store swat tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>swat_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the swat_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the swat files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux swat policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their swat processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for swat:</p>

<p>swat_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 901</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type swat_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>faillog_t</p>

<p>/var/log/btmp.* /var/log/faillog.* /var/log/tallylog.*
/var/run/faillock(/.*)?</p>

<p>samba_var_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/samba(/.*)? /var/cache/samba(/.*)?
/var/spool/samba(/.*)? /var/nmbd/unexpected(/.*)?</p>

<p>swat_tmp_t</p>

<p>swat_var_run_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux policy settings.</p>
