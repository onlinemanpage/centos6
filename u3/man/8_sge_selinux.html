<p>sge_selinux(8) sge SELinux Policy documentation
sge_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sge_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the sge processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures sge (Policy for
gridengine MPI jobs) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. sge policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run sge with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow sge to access nfs file systems, you
must turn on the sge_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sge_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sge policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sge processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sge:</p>

<p>sge_execd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_execd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the sge_execd_t domain.</p>

<p>sge_job_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_job_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the sge_job_t domain.</p>

<p>sge_shepherd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_shepherd_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the sge_shepherd_t
domain.</p>

<p>sge_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_spool_t type, if you want to
store the sge files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>sge_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_tmp_t type, if you want to
store sge temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sge policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their sge processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for sge:</p>

<p>sge_execd_t, sge_job_ssh_t, sge_shepherd_t,
sge_job_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
