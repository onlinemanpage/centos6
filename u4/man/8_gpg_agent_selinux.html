<p>gpg_agent_selinux(SELinux Policy documentation for
gpg_agegpg_agent_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gpg_agent_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the gpg_agent processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
gpg_agent processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The gpg_agent processes execute with the gpg_agent_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep gpg_agent_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The gpg_agent_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;gpg_agent_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the gpg_agent_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/gpg-agent</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gpg_agent policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gpg_agent processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
gpg_agent:</p>

<p>gpg_agent_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a gpg_agent_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type gpg_agent_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. gpg_agent policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run gpg_agent with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow usage of the gpg-agent
--write-env-file option. This also allows gpg-agent to
manage user files, you must turn on the gpg_agent_env_file
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_agent_env_file 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow usage of the gpg-agent
--write-env-file option. This also allows gpg-agent to
manage user files, you must turn on the gpg_agent_env_file
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_agent_env_file 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gpg_agent policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their gpg_agent processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gpg_agent:</p>

<p>gpg_agent_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_agent_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the gpg_agent_t domain.</p>

<p>gpg_agent_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_agent_tmp_t type, if you want
to store gpg agent temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type gpg_agent_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>gpg_agent_tmp_t</p>

<p>gpg_secret_t</p>

<p>/root/.gnupg(/.+)? /home/[^/]*/.gnupg(/.+)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
