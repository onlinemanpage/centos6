<p>lircd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for lircd
lircd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME lircd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the lircd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lircd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The lircd processes execute with the lircd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep lircd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The lircd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;lircd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the lircd_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/lircd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their lircd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for lircd:</p>

<p>lircd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a lircd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type lircd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lircd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for lircd:</p>

<p>lircd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lircd_etc_t type, if you want to
store lircd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>lircd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lircd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the lircd_t domain.</p>

<p>lircd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lircd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the lircd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>lircd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lircd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the lircd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lircd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for lircd:</p>

<p>lirc_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8765</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type lircd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>lircd_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/lirc(/.*)? /var/run/lircd(/.*)?
/var/run/lircd.pid</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>var_lock_t</p>

<p>/var/lock(/.*)?</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
