<p>init_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for init
init_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME init_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the init processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the init
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The init processes execute with the init_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep init_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The init_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,init_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the init_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /sbin/init(ng)?, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux init policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their init pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for init:</p>

<p>initrc_t, init_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a init_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type init_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. init policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run init with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to enable support for upstart as the init
program, you must turn on the init_upstart boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P init_upstart 1</p>

<p>If you want to enable support for upstart as the init
program, you must turn on the init_upstart boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P init_upstart 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux init policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their init processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for init:</p>

<p>init_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the init_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the init_t domain.</p>

<p>init_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the init_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the init files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>initctl_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initctl_t type, if you want to
treat the files as initctl data.</p>

<p>initrc_devpts_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initrc_devpts_t type, if you want
to treat the files as initrc devpts data.</p>

<p>initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initrc_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>initrc_state_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initrc_state_t type, if you want to
treat the files as initrc state data.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initrc_tmp_t type, if you want to
store initrc temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>initrc_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the initrc_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the initrc files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type init_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
