<p>roundup_selinux(8) roundup SELinux Policy documentation
roundup_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME roundup_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the roundup pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures roundup (Roundup Issue
Tracking System policy) processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux roundup policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their roundup processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for roundup:</p>

<p>roundup_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the roundup_t domain.</p>

<p>roundup_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the roundup_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>roundup_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the roundup files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>roundup_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the roundup_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the roundup files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux roundup policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their roundup processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for roundup:</p>

<p>roundup_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
