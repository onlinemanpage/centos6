<p>qemu_selinux(8) qemu SELinux Policy documentation
qemu_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME qemu_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the qemu processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures qemu (QEMU machine
emulator and virtualizer) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. qemu policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run qemu with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to use cifs/Samba file system,
you must turn on the qemu_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to user serial/parallel
communication port, you must turn on the qemu_use_comm
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_use_comm 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to use nfs file system, you
must turn on the qemu_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to use usb device, you must
turn on the qemu_use_usb boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_use_usb 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to connect fully to the
networ, you must turn on the qemu_full_network boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_full_network 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux qemu policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their qemu processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for qemu:</p>

<p>qemu_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qemu_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the qemu_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/qemu-system-.*, /usr/libexec/qemu.*,
/usr/bin/qemu, /usr/bin/qemu-kvm</p>

<p>qemu_image_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qemu_image_t type, if you want to
treat the files as qemu image data.</p>

<p>qemu_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qemu_tmp_t type, if you want to
store qemu tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>qemu_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qemu_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store qemu files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>qemu_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the qemu_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the qemu files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/libvirt/qemu(/.*)?,
/var/run/libvirt/qemu(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux qemu policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their qemu pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for qemu:</p>

<p>qemu_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
