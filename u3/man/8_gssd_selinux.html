<p>gssd_selinux(8) gssd SELinux Policy documentation
gssd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gssd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the gssd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. gssd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run gssd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory. For
access to ker- beros tgt, you must turn on the
allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gssd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gssd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gssd:</p>

<p>gssd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the gssd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/rpc.gssd, /usr/sbin/rpc.svcgssd</p>

<p>gssd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>gssd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store gssd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gssd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their gssd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for gssd:</p>

<p>gssd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
