<p>nscd_selinux(8) nscd SELinux Policy documentation
nscd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME nscd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the nscd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures nscd (Name service
cache daemon) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. nscd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run nscd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd
shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux nscd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their nscd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for nscd:</p>

<p>nscd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nscd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the nscd_t domain.</p>

<p>nscd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nscd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the nscd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>nscd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nscd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as nscd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>nscd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nscd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the nscd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/nscd.pid, /var/run/nscd(/.*)?,
/var/db/nscd(/.*)?, /var/run/.nscd_socket,
/var/cache/nscd(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux nscd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their nscd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for nscd:</p>

<p>nscd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
