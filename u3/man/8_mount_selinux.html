<p>mount_selinux(8) mount SELinux Policy documentation
mount_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mount_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mount processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures mount (Policy for
mount) processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. mount policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run mount with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow the mount command to mount any
directory or file, you must turn on the allow_mount_anyfile
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mount_anyfile 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow xguest users to mount removable
medi, you must turn on the xguest_mount_media boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xguest_mount_media 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mount:</p>

<p>mount_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mount_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /sbin/mount.*, /sbin/umount.*, /bin/umount.*,
/bin/mount.*</p>

<p>mount_loopback_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_loopback_t type, if you want
to treat the files as mount loopback data.</p>

<p>mount_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_tmp_t type, if you want to
store mount tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>mount_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mount_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the mount files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/davfs2(/.*)?,
/var/cache/davfs2(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their mount pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mount:</p>

<p>mount_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
