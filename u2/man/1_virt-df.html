<p>virt-df(1) Virtualization Support virt-df(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-df - Display free space on virtual
filesystems</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-df [--options]</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] -d domname</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img ...]</p>

<p>Old style:</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] domname</p>

<p>virt-df [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-df&quot; is a command line tool
to display free space on virtual machine filesystems. Unlike
other tools, it doesnt just display the amount of space
allocated to a virtual machine, but can look inside the
virtual machine to see how much space is really being
used.</p>

<p>It is like the df(1) command, but for virtual machines,
except that it also works for Windows virtual machines.</p>

<p>If used without any arguments, &quot;virt-df&quot;
checks with libvirt to get a list of all active and inactive
guests, and performs a &quot;df&quot;-type operation on each
one in turn, printing out the results.</p>

<p>If used with any argument(s), &quot;virt-df&quot;
performs a &quot;df&quot;-type operation on either the
single named libvirt domain, or on the disk image(s) listed
on the command line (which must all belong to a single VM).
In this mode (with arguments), &quot;virt-df&quot; will only
work for a single guest. If you want to run on multiple
guests, then you have to invoke &quot;virt-df&quot; multiple
times.</p>

<p>Use the &quot;--csv&quot; option to get a format which
can be easily parsed by other programs. Other options are
mostly similar to standard &quot;df&quot; options. See below
for the complete list.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>-a file --add file Add file which should be a disk image
from a virtual machine. If the virtual machine has multiple
block devices, you must supply all of them with separate -a
options.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>If you specify guest block devices directly (-a), then
libvirt is not used at all.</p>

<p>--csv Write out the results in CSV format
(comma-separated values). This format can be imported easily
into databases and spreadsheets, but read &quot;NOTE ABOUT
CSV FORMAT&quot; below.</p>

<p>-d guest --domain guest Add all the disks from the named
libvirt guest.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format The default for the -a
option is to auto-detect the format of the disk image. Using
this forces the disk format for -a options which follow on
the command line. Using --format with no argument switches
back to auto-detection for subsequent -a options.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>virt-df --format=raw -a disk.img</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot;.</p>

<p>virt-df --format=raw -a disk.img --format -a
another.img</p>

<p>forces raw format (no auto-detection) for
&quot;disk.img&quot; and reverts to auto-detection for
&quot;another.img&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you
should use this option to specify the disk format. This
avoids a possible security problem with malicious guests
(CVE-2010-3851).</p>

<p>-h --human-readable Print sizes in human-readable
format.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to use -h and --csv at the same
time.</p>

<p>--inodes | -i Print inodes instead of blocks.</p>

<p>--one-per-guest Run one libguestfs appliance per guest.
Normally &quot;virt-df&quot; will add the disks from several
guests to a single libguestfs appliance.</p>

<p>You might use this option in the following
circumstances:</p>

<p>&middot; If you think an untrusted guest might actively
try to exploit the libguestfs appliance kernel, then this
prevents one guest from interfering with the stats printed
for another guest.</p>

<p>&middot; If the kernel has a bug which stops it from
accessing a filesystem in one guest (see for example
RHBZ#635373) then this allows libguestfs to continue and
report stats for further guests.</p>

<p>--uuid Print UUIDs instead of names. This is useful for
following a guest even when the guest is migrated or
renamed, or when two guests happen to have the same
name.</p>

<p>Note that only domains that we fetch from libvirt come
with UUIDs. For disk images, we still print the disk image
name even when this option is specified.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages for debugging.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-x Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.</p>

<p>NOTE ABOUT CSV FORMAT Comma-separated values (CSV) is a
deceptive format. It seems like it should be easy to parse,
but it is definitely not easy to parse.</p>

<p>Myth: Just split fields at commas. Reality: This does
not work reliably. This example has two columns:</p>

<p>&quot;foo,bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>Myth: Read the file one line at a time. Reality: This
does not work reliably. This example has one row:</p>

<p>&quot;foo bar&quot;,baz</p>

<p>For shell scripts, use &quot;csvtool&quot;
(&lt;http://merjis.com/developers/csv&gt; also packaged in
major Linux distributions).</p>

<p>For other languages, use a CSV processing library (eg.
&quot;Text::CSV&quot; for Perl or Pythons built-in csv
library).</p>

<p>Most spreadsheets and databases can import CSV
directly.</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
