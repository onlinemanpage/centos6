<p>NAME netlabel_mgmt_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the netla- bel_mgmt processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
netlabel_mgmt processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The netlabel_mgmt processes execute with the
netlabel_mgmt_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by executing the ps command with the
-Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep netlabel_mgmt_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The netlabel_mgmt_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;netla- bel_mgmt_exec_t&quot; file
type. The default entrypoint paths for the net- label_mgmt_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/sbin/netlabelctl</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux netlabel_mgmt policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their netlabel_mgmt processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
netlabel_mgmt:</p>

<p>netlabel_mgmt_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a netlabel_mgmt_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type netlabel_mgmt_t
permissive. Per- missive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux netlabel_mgmt policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their netlabel_mgmt processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
netlabel_mgmt:</p>

<p>netlabel_mgmt_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the netlabel_mgmt_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the netlabel_mgmt_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type netlabel_mgmt_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
