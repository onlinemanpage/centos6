<p>mcelog_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
mcelog mcelog_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mcelog_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mcelog pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mcelog
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The mcelog processes execute with the mcelog_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep mcelog_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The mcelog_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mcelog_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the mcelog_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/mcelog</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mcelog policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their mcelog processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mcelog:</p>

<p>mcelog_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a mcelog_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type mcelog_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mcelog policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mcelog processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mcelog:</p>

<p>mcelog_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mcelog_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the mcelog_t domain.</p>

<p>mcelog_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mcelog_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as mcelog log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>mcelog_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mcelog_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the mcelog files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type mcelog_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mcelog_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/mcelog.*</p>

<p>mcelog_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/mcelog.*</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>sysfs_t</p>

<p>/sys(/.*)?</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
