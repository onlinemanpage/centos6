<p>mpd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for mpd
mpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the mpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mpd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The mpd processes execute with the mpd_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep mpd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The mpd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mpd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default entrypoint
paths for the mpd_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/mpd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mpd:</p>

<p>mpd_t, mplayer_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a mpd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type mpd_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. mpd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run mpd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory. For
access to ker- beros tgt, you must turn on the
allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must
turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to
/, you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Apache to execute tmp content, you
must turn on the httpd_tmp_exec boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_tmp_exec 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory. For
access to ker- beros tgt, you must turn on the
allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must
turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to
/, you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Apache to execute tmp content, you
must turn on the httpd_tmp_exec boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_tmp_exec 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mpd:</p>

<p>mpd_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_data_t type, if you want to
treat the files as mpd content.</p>

<p>mpd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_etc_t type, if you want to
store mpd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>mpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the mpd_t domain.</p>

<p>mpd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the mpd_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>mpd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as mpd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>mpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store mpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>mpd_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store mpd files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>mpd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mpd_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the mpd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for mpd:</p>

<p>mpd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 6600</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type mpd_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>anon_inodefs_t</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>mpd_data_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/mpd/music(/.*)?
/var/lib/mpd/playlists(/.*)?</p>

<p>mpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>mpd_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>mpd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/mpd(/.*)?</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
