<p>l2tpd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for l2tpd
l2tpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME l2tpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the l2tpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the l2tpd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The l2tpd processes execute with the l2tpd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep l2tpd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The l2tpd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,l2tpd_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the l2tpd_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/xl2tpd, /usr/sbin/prol2tpd,
/usr/sbin/openl2tpd, all files on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their l2tpd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tpd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a l2tpd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type l2tpd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the l2tpd_t domain.</p>

<p>l2tpd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the l2tpd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>l2tpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store l2tpd tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>l2tpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the l2tpd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the l2tpd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for l2tpd:</p>

<p>l2tp_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 1701 udp 1701</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type l2tpd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
