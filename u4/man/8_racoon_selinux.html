<p>racoon_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
racoon racoon_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME racoon_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the racoon pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the racoon
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The racoon processes execute with the racoon_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep racoon_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The racoon_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;racoon_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the racoon_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/racoon</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for racoon:</p>

<p>racoon_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a racoon_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type racoon_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. racoon policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run racoon with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow racoon to read shadow, you must
turn on the racoon_read_shadow boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P racoon_read_shadow 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow racoon to read shadow, you must
turn on the racoon_read_shadow boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P racoon_read_shadow 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for racoon:</p>

<p>racoon_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the racoon_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the racoon_t domain.</p>

<p>racoon_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the racoon_tmp_t type, if you want to
store racoon temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type racoon_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>faillog_t</p>

<p>/var/log/btmp.* /var/log/faillog.* /var/log/tallylog.*
/var/run/faillock(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>ipsec_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/racoon(/.*)? /var/run/pluto(/.*)?
/var/run/racoon.pid</p>

<p>krb5_host_rcache_t</p>

<p>/var/cache/krb5rcache(/.*)? /var/tmp/host_0
/var/tmp/HTTP_23</p>

<p>lastlog_t</p>

<p>/var/log/lastlog.*</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>pcscd_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/pcscd.events(/.*)? /var/run/pcscd.pid
/var/run/pcscd.pub /var/run/pcscd.comm</p>

<p>racoon_tmp_t</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>security_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
