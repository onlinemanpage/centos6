<p>NAME abrt_handle_event_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the abrt_handle_event processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
abrt_handle_event processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The abrt_handle_event processes execute with the
abrt_handle_event_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep abrt_handle_event_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The abrt_handle_event_t SELinux type can be
entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,abrt_han-
dle_event_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the
abrt_handle_event_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/libexec/abrt-handle-event, all files
on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux abrt_handle_event policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their abrt_handle_event processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
abrt_handle_event:</p>

<p>abrt_handle_event_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a abrt_handle_event_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type abrt_handle_event_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. abrt_handle_event policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run abrt_handle_event with the
tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow ABRT to run in abrt_handle_event_t
domain to han- dle ABRT event scripts, you must turn on the
abrt_handle_event boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P abrt_handle_event 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ABRT to run in abrt_handle_event_t
domain to han- dle ABRT event scripts, you must turn on the
abrt_handle_event boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P abrt_handle_event 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux abrt_handle_event policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their abrt_handle_event
processes in as secure a method as possi- ble.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
abrt_handle_event:</p>

<p>abrt_handle_event_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the abrt_handle_event_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
abrt_handle_event_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
abrt_handle_event_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
