<p>amavis_selinux(8) amavis SELinux Policy documentation
amavis_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME amavis_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the amavis pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures amavis ( Daemon that
interfaces mail transfer agents and content checkers, such
as virus scanners. ) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for amavis:</p>

<p>amavis_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_etc_t type, if you want to
store amavis files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/amavis.conf, /etc/amavisd(/.*)?</p>

<p>amavis_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the amavis_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib(64)?/AntiVir/antivir,
/usr/sbin/amavisd.*</p>

<p>amavis_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the amavis_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>amavis_quarantine_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_quarantine_t type, if you
want to treat the files as amavis quarantine data.</p>

<p>amavis_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_spool_t type, if you want to
store the amavis files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>amavis_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_tmp_t type, if you want to
store amavis temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>amavis_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the amavis files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/amavis(/.*)?, /var/amavis(/.*)?</p>

<p>amavis_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_var_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as amavis var log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>amavis_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amavis_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the amavis files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for amavis:</p>

<p>amavisd_recv_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>amavisd_send_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for amavis:</p>

<p>amavis_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
