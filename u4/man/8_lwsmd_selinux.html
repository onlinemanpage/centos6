<p>lwsmd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for lwsmd
lwsmd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME lwsmd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the lwsmd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lwsmd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The lwsmd processes execute with the lwsmd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep lwsmd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The lwsmd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;lwsmd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the lwsmd_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/lwsmd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux lwsmd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their lwsmd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for lwsmd:</p>

<p>lwsmd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a lwsmd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type lwsmd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux lwsmd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their lwsmd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for lwsmd:</p>

<p>lwsmd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lwsmd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the lwsmd_t domain.</p>

<p>lwsmd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lwsmd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the lwsmd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>lwsmd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lwsmd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the lwsmd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>lwsmd_var_socket_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the lwsmd_var_socket_t type, if you
want to treat the files as lwsmd var socket data.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type lwsmd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>lwsmd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>lwsmd_var_run_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
