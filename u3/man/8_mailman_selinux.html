<p>mailman_selinux(8) mailman SELinux Policy documentation
mailman_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mailman_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the mailman pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures mailman (Mailman is
for managing electronic mail discussion and e-newsletter
lists) processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux mailman policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their mailman processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for mailman:</p>

<p>mailman_archive_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_archive_t type, if you want
to treat the files as mailman archive data.</p>

<p>mailman_cgi_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_cgi_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the mailman_cgi_t
domain.</p>

<p>mailman_cgi_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_cgi_tmp_t type, if you want
to store mail- man cgi temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>mailman_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_data_t type, if you want to
treat the files as mailman content.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/mailman(/.*)?, /var/spool/mailman(/.*)?,
/var/lib/mail- man(/.*)?</p>

<p>mailman_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as mailman lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lock/mailman(/.*)?,
/var/run/mailman(/.*)?</p>

<p>mailman_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as mailman log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>mailman_mail_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_mail_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the mailman_mail_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib(64)?/mailman/mail/mailman,
/usr/lib(64)?/mail- man/bin/mailmanctl,
/usr/lib(64)?/mailman/scripts/mailman</p>

<p>mailman_mail_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_mail_tmp_t type, if you
want to store mailman mail temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>mailman_queue_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_queue_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the mailman_queue_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib(64)?/mailman/bin/qrunner,
/usr/lib/mailman/cron/.*</p>

<p>mailman_queue_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the mailman_queue_tmp_t type, if you
want to store mailman queue temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux mailman policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their mailman processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for mailman:</p>

<p>mailman_cgi_t, mailman_mail_t, mailman_queue_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
