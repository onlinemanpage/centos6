<p>NAME blkdeactivate - utility to deactivate block
devices</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS blkdeactivate [options] [device...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION blkdeactivate utility deactivates block
devices. If a device is mounted, the utility can unmount it
automatically before trying to deactivate. The utility
currently supports device-mapper devices, including LVM
volumes. LVM volumes are handled directly using the lvm
command. Other device-mapper based devices are handled using
the dmsetup command.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -h, --help Display the help text.</p>

<p>-u, --umount Unmount a mounted device before trying to
deactivate it. With- out this option used, a device that is
mounted is not deacti- vated.</p>

<p>-d, --dmoption dm_options Comma separated list of
device-mapper specific options.</p>

<p>-l, --lvmoption lvm_options Comma separated list of LVM
specific options.</p>

<p>DM_OPTIONS retry Retry removal several times in case of
failure.</p>

<p>force Force device removal. See dmsetup(8) for more
information.</p>

<p>LVM_OPTIONS retry Retry removal several times in case of
failure.</p>
