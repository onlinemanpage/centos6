<p>SSSD-AD(5) File Formats and Conventions SSSD-AD(5)</p>

<p>NAME sssd-ad - the configuration file for SSSD</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the configuration
of the AD provider for sssd(8). For a detailed syntax
reference, refer to the FILE FORMAT section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>The AD provider is a back end used to connect to an
Active Directory server. This provider requires that the
machine be joined to the AD domain and a keytab is
available.</p>

<p>The AD provider supports connecting to Active Directory
2008 R2 or later. Earlier versions may work, but are
unsupported.</p>

<p>The AD provider is able to provide identity information
and authentication for entities from trusted domains as
well. Currently only trusted domains in the same forest are
recognized.</p>

<p>The AD provider accepts the same options used by the
sssd-ldap(5) identity provider and the sssd-krb5(5)
authentication provider with some exceptions described
below.</p>

<p>However, it is neither necessary nor recommended to set
these options. The AD provider can also be used as an
access, chpass and sudo provider. No configuration of the
access provider is required on the client side.</p>

<p>By default, the AD provider will map UID and GID values
from the objectSID parameter in Active Directory. For
details on this, see the ID MAPPING section below. If you
want to disable ID mapping and instead rely on POSIX
attributes defined in Active Directory, you should set</p>

<p>ldap_id_mapping = False</p>

<p>In order to retrieve users and groups using POSIX
attributes from trusted domains, the AD administrator must
make sure that the POSIX attributes are replicated to the
Global Catalog.</p>

<p>Users, groups and other entities served by SSSD are
always treated as case-insensitive in the AD provider for
compatibility with Active Directory&acute;s LDAP
implementation.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Refer to the section DOMAIN
SECTIONS of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.</p>

<p>ad_domain (string) Specifies the name of the Active
Directory domain. This is optional. If not provided, the
configuration domain name is used.</p>

<p>For proper operation, this option should be specified as
the lower-case version of the long version of the Active
Directory domain.</p>

<p>The short domain name (also known as the NetBIOS or the
flat name) is autodetected by the SSSD.</p>

<p>ad_server, ad_backup_server (string) The comma-separated
list of hostnames of the AD servers to which SSSD should
connect in order of preference. For more information on
failover and server redundancy, see the FAILOVER section.
This is optional if autodiscovery is enabled. For more
information on service discovery, refer to the SERVICE
DISCOVERY section.</p>

<p>ad_hostname (string) Optional. May be set on machines
where the hostname(5) does not reflect the fully qualified
name used in the Active Directory domain to identify this
host.</p>

<p>This field is used to determine the host principal in
use in the keytab. It must match the hostname for which the
keytab was issued.</p>

<p>ad_enable_dns_sites (boolean) Enables DNS sites -
location based service discovery.</p>

<p>If true and service discovery (see Service Discovery
paragraph at the bottom of the man page) is enabled, the
SSSD will first attempt to discover the Active Directory
server to connect to using the Active Directory Site
Discovery and fall back to the DNS SRV records if no AD site
is found. The DNS SRV configuration, including the discovery
domain, is used during site discovery as well.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>ad_access_filter (boolean) This option specifies LDAP
access control filter that the user must match in order to
be allowed access. Please note that the access_provider
option must be explicitly set to ad in order for this option
to have an effect.</p>

<p>The option also supports specifying different filters
per domain or forest. This extended filter would consist of:
KEYWORD:NAME:FILTER. The keyword can be either DOM , FOREST
or missing.</p>

<p>If the keyword equals to DOM or is missing, then NAME
specifies the domain or subdomain the filter applies to. If
the keyword equals to FOREST , then the filter equals to all
domains from the forest specified by NAME.</p>

<p>Multiple filters can be separated with the ? character,
similarly to how search bases work.</p>

<p>The most specific match is always used. For example, if
the option specified filter for a domain the user is a
member of and a global filter, the per-domain filter would
be applied. If there are more matches with the same
specification, the first one is used.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p># apply filter on domain called dom1 only:
dom1:(memberOf=cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=dom1,dc=com)</p>

<p># apply filter on domain called dom2 only:
DOM:dom2:(memberOf=cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=dom2,dc=com)</p>

<p># apply filter on forest called EXAMPLE.COM only:
FOREST:EXAMPLE.COM:(memberOf=cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)</p>

<p>Default: Not set</p>

<p>ad_enable_gc (boolean) By default, the SSSD connects to
the Global Catalog first to retrieve users from trusted
domains and uses the LDAP port to retrieve group memberships
or as a fallback. Disabling this option makes the SSSD only
connect to the LDAP port of the current AD server.</p>

<p>Please note that disabling Global Catalog support does
not disable retrieving users from trusted domains. The SSSD
would connect to the LDAP port of trusted domains instead.
However, Global Catalog must be used in order to resolve
cross-domain group memberships.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>dyndns_update (boolean) Optional. This option tells SSSD
to automatically update the Active Directory DNS server with
the IP address of this client. The update is secured using
GSS-TSIG. As a consequence, the Active Directory
administrator only needs to allow secure updates for the DNS
zone. The IP address of the AD LDAP connection is used for
the updates, if it is not otherwise specified by using the
dyndns_iface option.</p>

<p>NOTE: On older systems (such as RHEL 5), for this
behavior to work reliably, the default Kerberos realm must
be set properly in /etc/krb5.conf</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>dyndns_ttl (integer) The TTL to apply to the client DNS
record when updating it. If dyndns_update is false this has
no effect. This will override the TTL serverside if set by
an administrator.</p>

<p>Default: 3600 (seconds)</p>

<p>dyndns_iface (string) Optional. Applicable only when
dyndns_update is true. Choose the interface whose IP address
should be used for dynamic DNS updates.</p>

<p>Default: Use the IP address of the AD LDAP
connection</p>

<p>dyndns_refresh_interval (integer) How often should the
back end perform periodic DNS update in addition to the
automatic update performed when the back end goes online.
This option is optional and applicable only when
dyndns_update is true.</p>

<p>Default: 86400 (24 hours)</p>

<p>dyndns_update_ptr (bool) Whether the PTR record should
also be explicitly updated when updating the client&acute;s
DNS records. Applicable only when dyndns_update is true.</p>

<p>Default: True</p>

<p>dyndns_force_tcp (bool) Whether the nsupdate utility
should default to using TCP for communicating with the DNS
server.</p>

<p>Default: False (let nsupdate choose the protocol)</p>

<p>override_homedir (string) Override the user&acute;s home
directory. You can either provide an absolute value or a
template. In the template, the following sequences are
substituted:</p>

<p>%u login name</p>

<p>%U UID number</p>

<p>%d domain name</p>

<p>%f fully qualified user name (user@domain)</p>

<p>%o The original home directory retrieved from the
identity provider.</p>

<p>%H The value of configure option homedir_substring.</p>

<p>%% a literal &acute;%&acute;</p>

<p>This option can also be set per-domain.</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p>override_homedir = /home/%u</p>

<p>Default: Not set (SSSD will use the value retrieved from
LDAP)</p>

<p>homedir_substring (string) The value of this option will
be used in the expansion of the override_homedir option if
the template contains the format string %H. An LDAP
directory entry can directly contain this template so that
this option can be used to expand the home directory path
for each client machine (or operating system). It can be set
per-domain or globally in the [nss] section. A value
specified in a domain section will override one set in the
[nss] section.</p>

<p>Default: /home</p>

<p>krb5_use_enterprise_principal (boolean) Specifies if the
user principal should be treated as enterprise principal.
See section 5 of RFC 6806 for more details about enterprise
principals.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>Note that this default differs from the traditional
Kerberos provider back end.</p>

<p>FAILOVER The failover feature allows back ends to
automatically switch to a different server if the current
server fails.</p>

<p>Failover Syntax The list of servers is given as a
comma-separated list; any number of spaces is allowed around
the comma. The servers are listed in order of preference.
The list can contain any number of servers.</p>

<p>For each failover-enabled config option, two variants
exist: primary and backup. The idea is that servers in the
primary list are preferred and backup servers are only
searched if no primary servers can be reached. If a backup
server is selected, a timeout of 31 seconds is set. After
this timeout SSSD will periodically try to reconnect to one
of the primary servers. If it succeeds, it will replace the
current active (backup) server.</p>

<p>The Failover Mechanism The failover mechanism
distinguishes between a machine and a service. The back end
first tries to resolve the hostname of a given machine; if
this resolution attempt fails, the machine is considered
offline. No further attempts are made to connect to this
machine for any other service. If the resolution attempt
succeeds, the back end tries to connect to a service on this
machine. If the service connection attempt fails, then only
this particular service is considered offline and the back
end automatically switches over to the next service. The
machine is still considered online and might still be tried
for another service.</p>

<p>Further connection attempts are made to machines or
services marked as offline after a specified period of time;
this is currently hard coded to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If there are no more machines to try, the back end as a
whole switches to offline mode, and then attempts to
reconnect every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>SERVICE DISCOVERY The service discovery feature allows
back ends to automatically find the appropriate servers to
connect to using a special DNS query. This feature is not
supported for backup servers.</p>

<p>Configuration If no servers are specified, the back end
automatically uses service discovery to try to find a
server. Optionally, the user may choose to use both fixed
server addresses and service discovery by inserting a
special keyword, _srv_, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.</p>

<p>The domain name Please refer to the dns_discovery_domain
parameter in the sssd.conf(5) manual page for more
details.</p>

<p>The protocol The queries usually specify _tcp as the
protocol. Exceptions are documented in respective option
description.</p>

<p>See Also For more information on the service discovery
mechanism, refer to RFC 2782.</p>

<p>ID MAPPING The ID-mapping feature allows SSSD to act as
a client of Active Directory without requiring
administrators to extend user attributes to support POSIX
attributes for user and group identifiers.</p>

<p>NOTE: When ID-mapping is enabled, the uidNumber and
gidNumber attributes are ignored. This is to avoid the
possibility of conflicts between automatically-assigned and
manually-assigned values. If you need to use
manually-assigned values, ALL values must be
manually-assigned.</p>

<p>Please note that changing the ID mapping related
configuration options will cause user and group IDs to
change. At the moment, SSSD does not support changing IDs,
so the SSSD database must be removed. Because cached
passwords are also stored in the database, removing the
database should only be performed while the authentication
servers are reachable, otherwise users might get locked out.
In order to cache the password, an authentication must be
performed. It is not sufficient to use sss_cache(8) to
remove the database, rather the process consists of:</p>

<p>&middot; Making sure the remote servers are
reachable</p>

<p>&middot; Stopping the SSSD service</p>

<p>&middot; Removing the database</p>

<p>&middot; Starting the SSSD service</p>

<p>Moreover, as the change of IDs might necessitate the
adjustment of other system properties such as file and
directory ownership, it&acute;s advisable to plan ahead and
test the ID mapping configuration thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mapping Algorithm Active Directory provides an objectSID
for every user and group object in the directory. This
objectSID can be broken up into components that represent
the Active Directory domain identity and the relative
identifier (RID) of the user or group object.</p>

<p>The SSSD ID-mapping algorithm takes a range of available
UIDs and divides it into equally-sized component sections -
called &quot;slices&quot;-. Each slice represents the space
available to an Active Directory domain.</p>

<p>When a user or group entry for a particular domain is
encountered for the first time, the SSSD allocates one of
the available slices for that domain. In order to make this
slice-assignment repeatable on different client machines, we
select the slice based on the following algorithm:</p>

<p>The SID string is passed through the murmurhash3
algorithm to convert it to a 32-bit hashed value. We then
take the modulus of this value with the total number of
available slices to pick the slice.</p>

<p>NOTE: It is possible to encounter collisions in the hash
and subsequent modulus. In these situations, we will select
the next available slice, but it may not be possible to
reproduce the same exact set of slices on other machines
(since the order that they are encountered will determine
their slice). In this situation, it is recommended to either
switch to using explicit POSIX attributes in Active
Directory (disabling ID-mapping) or configure a default
domain to guarantee that at least one is always consistent.
See Configuration for details.</p>

<p>Configuration Minimum configuration (in the
[domain/DOMAINNAME] section):</p>

<p>ldap_id_mapping = True ldap_schema = ad</p>

<p>The default configuration results in configuring 10,000
slices, each capable of holding up to 200,000 IDs, starting
from 10,001 and going up to 2,000,100,000. This should be
sufficient for most deployments.</p>

<p>Advanced Configuration ldap_idmap_range_min (integer)
Specifies the lower bound of the range of POSIX IDs to use
for mapping Active Directory user and group SIDs.</p>

<p>NOTE: This option is different from min_id in that
min_id acts to filter the output of requests to this domain,
whereas this option controls the range of ID assignment.
This is a subtle distinction, but the good general advice
would be to have min_id be less-than or equal to
ldap_idmap_range_min</p>

<p>Default: 200000</p>

<p>ldap_idmap_range_max (integer) Specifies the upper bound
of the range of POSIX IDs to use for mapping Active
Directory user and group SIDs.</p>

<p>NOTE: This option is different from max_id in that
max_id acts to filter the output of requests to this domain,
whereas this option controls the range of ID assignment.
This is a subtle distinction, but the good general advice
would be to have max_id be greater-than or equal to
ldap_idmap_range_max</p>

<p>Default: 2000200000</p>

<p>ldap_idmap_range_size (integer) Specifies the number of
IDs available for each slice. If the range size does not
divide evenly into the min and max values, it will create as
many complete slices as it can.</p>

<p>Default: 200000</p>

<p>ldap_idmap_default_domain_sid (string) Specify the
domain SID of the default domain. This will guarantee that
this domain will always be assigned to slice zero in the ID
map, bypassing the murmurhash algorithm described above.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>ldap_idmap_default_domain (string) Specify the name of
the default domain.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>ldap_idmap_autorid_compat (boolean) Changes the behavior
of the ID-mapping algorithm to behave more similarly to
winbind&acute;s idmap_autorid algorithm.</p>

<p>When this option is configured, domains will be
allocated starting with slice zero and increasing
monatomically with each additional domain.</p>

<p>NOTE: This algorithm is non-deterministic (it depends on
the order that users and groups are requested). If this mode
is required for compatibility with machines running winbind,
it is recommended to also use the
ldap_idmap_default_domain_sid option to guarantee that at
least one domain is consistently allocated to slice
zero.</p>

<p>Default: False</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example assumes that SSSD is
correctly configured and example.com is one of the domains
in the [sssd] section. This example shows only the AD
provider-specific options.</p>

<p>[domain/EXAMPLE] id_provider = ad auth_provider = ad
access_provider = ad chpass_provider = ad</p>

<p>ad_server = dc1.example.com ad_hostname =
client.example.com ad_domain = example.com</p>

<p>NOTES The AD access control provider checks if the
account is expired. It has the same effect as the following
configuration of the LDAP provider:</p>

<p>access_provider = ldap ldap_access_order = expire
ldap_account_expire_policy = ad</p>

<p>However, unless the ad access control provider is
explicitly configured, the default access provider is
permit.</p>
