<p>pingd_selinux(8) pingd SELinux Policy documentation
pingd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME pingd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the pingd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures pingd (Pingd of the
Whatsup cluster node up/down detection utility) processes
via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. pingd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run pingd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to control users use of ping and tracerout,
you must turn on the user_ping boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P user_ping 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pingd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for pingd:</p>

<p>ping_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ping_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ping_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/hping2, /usr/sbin/fping.*, /bin/ping.*,
/usr/sbin/send_arp</p>

<p>pingd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_etc_t type, if you want to
store pingd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>pingd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the pingd_t domain.</p>

<p>pingd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the pingd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>pingd_modules_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pingd_modules_t type, if you want
to treat the files as pingd modules.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pingd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for pingd:</p>

<p>pingd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their pingd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for pingd:</p>

<p>ping_t, pingd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
