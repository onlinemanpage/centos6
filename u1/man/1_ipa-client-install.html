<p>NAME ipa-client-install - Configure an IPA client</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-client-install [OPTION]...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Configures a client machine to use IPA for
authentication and identity services.</p>

<p>By default this configures SSSD to connect to an IPA
server for authen- tication and authorization. Optionally
one can instead configure PAM and NSS (Name Switching
Service) to work with an IPA server over Ker- beros and
LDAP.</p>

<p>An authorized user is required to join a client machine
to IPA. This can take the form of a kerberos principal or a
one-time password asso- ciated with the machine.</p>

<p>This same tool is used to unconfigure IPA and attemps to
return the machine to its previous state. Part of this
process is to unenroll the host from the IPA server.
Unenrollment consists of disabling the prinicipal key on the
IPA server so that it may be re-enrolled. The machine
principal in /etc/krb5.keytab (host/&lt;fqdn&gt;@REALM) is
used to authenticate to the IPA server to unenroll itself.
If this principal does not exist then unenrollment will fail
and an administrator will need to disable the host principal
(ipa host-disable &lt;fqdn&gt;).</p>

<p>OPTIONS --domain=DOMAIN Set the domain name to
DOMAIN</p>

<p>--server=SERVER Set the IPA server to connect to</p>

<p>--realm=REALM_NAME Set the IPA realm name to
REALM_NAME</p>

<p>--hostname The hostname of this server (FQDN). By
default of nodename from uname(2) is used.</p>

<p>-f, --force Force the settings even if errors occur</p>

<p>-d, --debug Print debugging information to stdout</p>

<p>-U, --unattended Unattended installation. The user will
not be prompted.</p>

<p>-N, --no-ntp Do not configure or enable NTP.</p>

<p>--ntp-server=NTP_SERVER Configure ntpd to use this NTP
server.</p>

<p>-S, --no-sssd Do not configure the client to use SSSD
for authentication, use nss_ldap instead.</p>

<p>--on-master The client is being configured on an IPA
server.</p>

<p>-w PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD Password for joining a
machine to the IPA realm. Assumes bulk password unless
principal is also set.</p>

<p>-W Prompt for the password for joining a machine to the
IPA realm.</p>

<p>-p, --principal Authorized kerberos principal to use to
join the IPA realm.</p>

<p>--permit Configure SSSD to permit all access. Otherwise
the machine will be controlled by the Host-based Access
Controls (HBAC) on the IPA server.</p>

<p>--mkhomedir Configure pam to create a users home
directory if it does not exist.</p>

<p>--uninstall Remove the IPA client software and restore
the configuration to the pre-IPA state.</p>

<p>--enable-dns-updates This option tells SSSD to
automatically update DNS with the IP address of this
client.</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the installation was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>

<p>2 if uninstalling and the client is not configured</p>
