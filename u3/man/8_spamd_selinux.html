<p>spamd_selinux(8) spamd SELinux Policy documentation
spamd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME spamd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the spamd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. spamd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run spamd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow user spamassassin clients to use
the network, you must turn on the spamassassin_can_network
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamassassin_can_network 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow spamd to read/write user home
directories, you must turn on the spamd_enable_home_dirs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamd_enable_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to check spa, you must
turn on the httpd_can_check_spam boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_check_spam 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their spamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamd_compiled_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_compiled_t type, if you want
to treat the files as spamd compiled data.</p>

<p>spamd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_etc_t type, if you want to
store spamd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>spamd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the spamd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/spamd, /usr/bin/mimedefang-multiplexor,
/usr/bin/spamd, /usr/bin/mimedefang</p>

<p>spamd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the spamd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/spamassassin,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/spamd, /etc/rc.d/init.d/mimedefang.*</p>

<p>spamd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as spamd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/razor-agent.log, /var/log/spamd.log,
/var/log/mimedefang</p>

<p>spamd_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_spool_t type, if you want to
store the spamd files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/spool/spamd(/.*)?,
/var/spool/spamassassin(/.*)?</p>

<p>spamd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store spamd tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>spamd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the spamd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/spamassassin(/.*)?,
/var/lib/razor(/.*)?</p>

<p>spamd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the spamd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/spamassassin(/.*)?,
/var/spool/MIMEDefang(/.*)?,
/var/spool/MD-Quarantine(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their spamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their spamd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamc_t, spamd_t, spamass_milter_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
