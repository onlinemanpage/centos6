<p>hald_sonypic_seliSELinux Policy documentation for
hald_hald_sonypic_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME hald_sonypic_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the hald_sonypic processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
hald_sonypic processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The hald_sonypic processes execute with the
hald_sonypic_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these
processes running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep hald_sonypic_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The hald_sonypic_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;hald_sonypic_exec_t&quot; file type.
The default entrypoint paths for the hald_sonypic_t domain
are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/libexec/hal-system-sonypic</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux hald_sonypic policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their hald_sonypic processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
hald_sonypic:</p>

<p>hald_sonypic_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a hald_sonypic_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type hald_sonypic_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux hald_sonypic policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their hald_sonypic processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
hald_sonypic:</p>

<p>hald_sonypic_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the hald_sonypic_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the hald_sonypic_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type hald_sonypic_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>hald_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/pm(/.*)? /var/log/pm-.*.log.*</p>

<p>hald_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/hal(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
