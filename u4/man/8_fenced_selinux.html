<p>fenced_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
fenced fenced_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME fenced_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the fenced pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fenced
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The fenced processes execute with the fenced_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep fenced_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The fenced_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;fenced_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the fenced_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/fenced, /usr/sbin/fence_node,
/usr/sbin/fence_tool, /usr/sbin/fence_virtd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux fenced policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their fenced processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for fenced:</p>

<p>fenced_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a fenced_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type fenced_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. fenced policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run fenced with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow fenced domain to connect to the
network using TCP, you must turn on the
fenced_can_network_connect boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fenced_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow fenced domain to execute ssh, you
must turn on the fenced_can_ssh boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fenced_can_ssh 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow fenced domain to connect to the
network using TCP, you must turn on the
fenced_can_network_connect boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fenced_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow fenced domain to execute ssh, you
must turn on the fenced_can_ssh boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P fenced_can_ssh 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux fenced policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their fenced processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for fenced:</p>

<p>fenced_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the fenced_t domain.</p>

<p>fenced_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as fenced lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>fenced_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_tmp_t type, if you want to
store fenced temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>fenced_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store fenced files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>fenced_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_var_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as fenced var log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>fenced_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the fenced_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the fenced files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type fenced_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>cluster_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/cluster(/.*)?</p>

<p>fenced_lock_t</p>

<p>/var/lock/fence_manual.lock</p>

<p>fenced_tmp_t</p>

<p>fenced_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>fenced_var_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/cluster/fenced.log.*</p>

<p>fenced_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/cluster/fence_scsi.* /var/run/fenced.pid
/var/run/cluster/fenced_override</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>snmpd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/agentx(/.*)? /var/net-snmp(/.*) /var/lib/snmp(/.*)?
/var/lib/net-snmp(/.*)? /usr/share/snmp/mibs/.index</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
