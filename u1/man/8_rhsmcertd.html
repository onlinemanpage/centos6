<p>rhsmcertd(8) Subscription Management Certificate Daemon
rhsmcertd(8)</p>

<p>NAME rhsmcertd - Periodically scans and updates the
entitlement certificates on a registered system.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS rhsmcertd start|stop|status|restart</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Red Hat provides content updates and support
by issuing subscriptions for its products. These
subscriptions are allocated to systems (machines). Red Hat
Subscription Manager is a tool which allows admin- istrators
to manage those subscriptions by registering systems and
peo- ple, assigning subscriptions, and viewing
subscriptions.</p>

<p>When subscriptions are allocated to a system or when new
subscriptions are available, the subscription management
system issues that machine an X.509 certificate which
contains all of the details of that sub- scription. The
rhsmcertd process runs periodically to check for changes in
the subscriptions available to a machine by updating the
entitlement certificates installed on the machine and by
installing new entitlement certificates as theyre
available.</p>

<p>The entitlements system also issues the system X.509
certificates that grant that system access to the
appropriate content repositories for the system to be able
to access its subscribed product downloads and updates.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd is started with the machine, by default, and
is always run- ning in the background. At the interval set
in the rhsm.conf file, the process checks with the Red Hat
Entitlement System to see if any new subscriptions are
available to the system and pulls down any new cer-
tificates. The frequency is configured in minutes in the
[rhsmcertd] section of the Red Hat Subscription Managers
configuration file.</p>

<p>[rhsmcertd] certFrequency= 240</p>

<p>This process invokes the certmgr.py script to perform
the certificate add and update operations.</p>

<p>USAGE rhsmcertd restart</p>

<p>ASSOCIATED FILES * /usr/share/rhsm/certmgr.py</p>

<p>* /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf</p>
