<p>PMFIND(1) PMFIND(1)</p>

<p>NAME pmfind - find PCP services on the network</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS pmfind [-q] [-m mechanism] [-s service]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmfind searches for instances of the
specified PCP service being adver- tised on the network and
prints a list of URLs corresponding to the services
discovered.</p>

<p>By default pmfind will search for servers advertising
the pmcd(1) ser- vice, however an alternate PCP service to
discover can be specified using the -s option.</p>

<p>The -m option sets the mechanism that pmfind uses when
performing ser- vice discovery. By default, or if the
keyword &quot;all&quot; is specified, every available
mechanism will be used (iteratively). Currently,
&quot;avahi&quot; is the only supported discovery
mechanism.</p>

<p>The -q option suppresses all output on the standard
output stream.</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>

<p>DIAGNOSTICS The value of the exit status from the
command is zero when services were successfully located, one
if no services were found, and two if an error occurred.</p>

<p>In the event of an error, a message will be generated on
standard error that is intended to be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>SEE ALSO PCPIntro(1), pmcd(1), PMAPI(3),
pmDiscoverServices(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).</p>
