<p>aiccu_selinux(8) aiccu SELinux Policy documentation
aiccu_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME aiccu_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the aiccu processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures aiccu (Automatic IPv6
Connectivity Client Util- ity) processes via flexible
mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux aiccu policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their aiccu processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for aiccu:</p>

<p>aiccu_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aiccu_etc_t type, if you want to
store aiccu files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>aiccu_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aiccu_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the aiccu_t domain.</p>

<p>aiccu_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aiccu_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the aiccu_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>aiccu_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the aiccu_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the aiccu files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux aiccu policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their aiccu pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for aiccu:</p>

<p>aiccu_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
