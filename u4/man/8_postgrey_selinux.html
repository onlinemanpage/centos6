<p>postgrey_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
postgrepostgrey_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME postgrey_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the postgrey pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the postgrey
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The postgrey processes execute with the postgrey_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep postgrey_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The postgrey_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;postgrey_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the postgrey_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/postgrey</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
postgrey:</p>

<p>postgrey_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a postgrey_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type postgrey_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for postgrey:</p>

<p>postgrey_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_etc_t type, if you want to
store postgrey files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>postgrey_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the postgrey_t domain.</p>

<p>postgrey_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the postgrey_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>postgrey_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_spool_t type, if you want
to store the postgrey files under the /var/spool
directory.</p>

<p>postgrey_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the postgrey files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>postgrey_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the postgrey_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the postgrey files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for postgrey:</p>

<p>postgrey_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 60000</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type postgrey_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>postfix_spool_type</p>

<p>postgrey_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/postfix/postgrey(/.*)?</p>

<p>postgrey_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/postgrey(/.*)?</p>

<p>postgrey_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/postgrey(/.*)? /var/run/postgrey.pid</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux policy settings.</p>
