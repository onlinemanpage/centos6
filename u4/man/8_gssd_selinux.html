<p>gssd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for gssd
gssd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gssd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the gssd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gssd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The gssd processes execute with the gssd_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep gssd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The gssd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;gssd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the gssd_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/rpc.gssd, /usr/sbin/rpc.svcgssd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gssd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their gssd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for gssd:</p>

<p>gssd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a gssd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type gssd_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. gssd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run gssd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory. For
access to ker- beros tgt, you must turn on the
allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory. For
access to ker- beros tgt, you must turn on the
allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gssd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gssd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gssd:</p>

<p>gssd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the gssd_t domain.</p>

<p>gssd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>gssd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gssd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store gssd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type gssd_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>auth_cache_t</p>

<p>/var/cache/coolkey(/.*)?</p>

<p>gssd_tmp_t</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>user_tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp/gconfd-.*</p>

<p>var_lib_nfs_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/nfs(/.*)?</p>

<p>xdm_tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp/.X11-unix(/.*)? /tmp/.ICE-unix(/.*)?
/tmp/.X0-lock</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
