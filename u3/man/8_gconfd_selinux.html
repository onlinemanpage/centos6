<p>gconfd_selinux(8) gconfd SELinux Policy documentation
gconfd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gconfd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the gconfd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gconfd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gconfd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gconfd:</p>

<p>gconf_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gconf_etc_t type, if you want to
store gconf files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>gconf_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gconf_home_t type, if you want to
store gconf files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /root/.gconf(d)?(/.*)?, /root/.local.*</p>

<p>gconf_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gconf_tmp_t type, if you want to
store gconf tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>gconfd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gconfd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the gconfd_t domain.</p>

<p>gconfdefaultsm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gconfdefaultsm_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the gconfdefaultsm_t
domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gconfd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their gconfd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for gconfd:</p>

<p>gconfdefaultsm_t, gconfd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
