<p>NAME ipa-compliance - Check entitlement compliance</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ipa-compliance [OPTION]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Verify that the IPA installation is in
compliance with the number of client entitlements it
has.</p>

<p>Entitlements are managed using the ipa entitle
command.</p>

<p>An enrolled host is an machine that has a host keytab in
the IPA sys- tem.</p>

<p>The entitlements take the form of x509v3 certificates.
The certificates are examined and the quantities summed.
This is compared to the number of enrolled hosts to
determine compliance.</p>

<p>The command logs to syslog and if run from a tty will
log to the termi- nal as well.</p>

<p>The IPA server provides 25 entitlements of its own.</p>

<p>OPTIONS ---debug Enable debugging output in the
command</p>

<p>EXIT STATUS 0 if the command was successful</p>

<p>1 if an error occurred</p>

<p>NOTES Entitlements are not checked if the python-rhsm
package is not installed.</p>
