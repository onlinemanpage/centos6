<p>dcc_selinux(8) dcc SELinux Policy documentation
dcc_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME dcc_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the dcc processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures dcc (Distributed
checksum clearinghouse spam fil- tering) processes via
flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux dcc policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their dcc processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for dcc:</p>

<p>dcc_client_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_client_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the dcc_client_t domain.</p>

<p>dcc_client_map_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_client_map_t type, if you want
to treat the files as dcc client map data.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/dcc/map, /etc/dcc/map, /var/dcc/map,
/var/run/dcc/map</p>

<p>dcc_client_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_client_tmp_t type, if you want
to store dcc client temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>dcc_dbclean_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_dbclean_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the dcc_dbclean_t
domain.</p>

<p>dcc_dbclean_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_dbclean_tmp_t type, if you want
to store dcc dbclean temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>dcc_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the dcc files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>dcc_var_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dcc_var_t type, if you want to
store the files under the /var directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/dcc(/.*)?, /var/dcc(/.*)?,
/var/lib/dcc(/.*)?</p>

<p>dccd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the dccd_t domain.</p>

<p>dccd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store dccd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>dccd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the dccd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>dccifd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccifd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the dccifd_t domain.</p>

<p>dccifd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccifd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store dccifd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>dccifd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccifd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the dccifd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/dcc/dccifd, /var/run/dcc/dccifd</p>

<p>dccm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the dccm_t domain.</p>

<p>dccm_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_tmp_t type, if you want to
store dccm tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>dccm_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the dccm files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux dcc policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their dcc processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for dcc:</p>

<p>dcc_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>dccm_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux dcc policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their dcc processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for dcc:</p>

<p>dccm_t, dcc_client_t, dcc_dbclean_t, dccifd_t,
dccd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
