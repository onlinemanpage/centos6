<p>cpucontrol_selinuxSELinux Policy documentation for
cpuconcpucontrol_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME cpucontrol_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the cpucontrol processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
cpucontrol processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The cpucontrol processes execute with the cpucontrol_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep cpucontrol_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The cpucontrol_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;cpucon- trol_exec_t&quot; file type. The
default entrypoint paths for the cpucon- trol_t domain are
the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/sbin/microcode_ctl</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cpucontrol policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cpu- control processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cpucontrol:</p>

<p>cpucontrol_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a cpucontrol_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type cpucontrol_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cpucontrol policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cpucontrol processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for cpucontrol:</p>

<p>cpucontrol_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cpucontrol_conf_t type, if you want
to treat the files as cpucontrol configuration data, usually
stored under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>cpucontrol_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cpucontrol_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the cpucontrol_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type cpucontrol_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
