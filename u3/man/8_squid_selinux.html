<p>squid_selinux(8) squid SELinux Policy documentation
squid_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME squid_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the squid processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures squid (Squid caching
http proxy server) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. squid policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run squid with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow squid to run as a transparent proxy
(TPROXY, you must turn on the squid_use_tproxy boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P squid_use_tproxy 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow squid to connect to all ports, not
just HTTP, FTP, and Gopher ports, you must turn on the
squid_connect_any boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P squid_connect_any 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux squid policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their squid processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for squid:</p>

<p>squid_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_cache_t type, if you want to
store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/cache/squid(/.*)?, /var/spool/squid(/.*)?,
/var/squid- Guard(/.*)?</p>

<p>squid_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as squid configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/squid(/.*)?, /usr/share/squid(/.*)?</p>

<p>squid_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the squid_t domain.</p>

<p>squid_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the squid_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>squid_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as squid log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/squid(/.*)?,
/var/log/squidGuard(/.*)?</p>

<p>squid_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the squid_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the squid files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux squid policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their squid processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for squid:</p>

<p>squid_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux squid policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their squid pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for squid:</p>

<p>squid_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
