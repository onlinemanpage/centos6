<p>clamd_selinux(8) clamd SELinux Policy documentation
clamd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME clamd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the clamd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. clamd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run clamd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow clamd to use JIT compile, you must
turn on the clamd_use_jit boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P clamd_use_jit 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for clamd:</p>

<p>clamd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_etc_t type, if you want to
store clamd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>clamd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the clamd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/clamd, /usr/sbin/clamav-milter</p>

<p>clamd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the clamd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>clamd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store clamd tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>clamd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the clamd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/clamd.*, /var/clamav(/.*)?,
/var/lib/clamav(/.*)?</p>

<p>clamd_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_var_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as clamd var log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/clamav.*, /var/log/clamd.*</p>

<p>clamd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the clamd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/clamd.*, /var/run/amavis(d)?/clamd.pid,
/var/spool/amav- isd/clamd.sock, /var/run/clamav.*,
/var/spool/MailScanner(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for clamd:</p>

<p>clamd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their clamd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for clamd:</p>

<p>clamd_t, clamscan_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
