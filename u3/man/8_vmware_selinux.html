<p>vmware_selinux(8) vmware SELinux Policy documentation
vmware_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME vmware_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the vmware pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures vmware (VMWare
Workstation virtual machines) pro- cesses via flexible
mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux vmware policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their vmware processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for vmware:</p>

<p>vmware_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as vmware configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>vmware_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the vmware_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-mks,
/usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmplayer,
/usr/lib64/vmware/bin/vmware-ui,
/usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-ui, /usr/sbin/vmware-serverd,
/usr/lib64/vmware/bin/vmplayer,
/usr/lib64/vmware/bin/vmware-mks, /usr/bin/vmware,
/usr/bin/vmware-wizard</p>

<p>vmware_file_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_file_t type, if you want to
treat the files as vmware content.</p>

<p>vmware_host_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_host_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the vmware_host_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd.bin,
/usr/bin/vmware-smbd, /usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin64/vmware.*,
/usr/bin/vmware-ping, /usr/bin/vmnet-dhcpd,
/usr/lib64/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx, /usr/bin/vmnet-bridge,
/usr/bin/vmware-nmbd, /usr/bin/vmnet-neti- fup,
/usr/sbin/vmware-guest.*, /usr/bin/vmware-network,
/usr/bin/vmware-vmx, /usr/bin/vmnet-natd,
/usr/bin/vmware-smb- passwd, /usr/bin/vmnet-sniffer,
/usr/lib/vmware- tools/sbin32/vmware.*,
/usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx</p>

<p>vmware_host_pid_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_host_pid_t type, if you want
to store the vmware host files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>vmware_host_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_host_tmp_t type, if you want
to store vmware host temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>vmware_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as vmware log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/vmware.*, /var/log/vnetlib.*</p>

<p>vmware_pid_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_pid_t type, if you want to
store the vmware files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>vmware_sys_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_sys_conf_t type, if you want
to treat the files as vmware sys configuration data, usually
stored under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib/vmware/config, /etc/vmware.*(/.*)?,
/usr/lib64/vmware/config</p>

<p>vmware_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_tmp_t type, if you want to
store vmware temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>vmware_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the vmware_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store vmware files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux vmware policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their vmware processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for vmware:</p>

<p>vmware_t, vmware_host_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
