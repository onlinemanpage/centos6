<p>sanlock_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
sanlock sanlock_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sanlock_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the sanlock pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sanlock
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The sanlock processes execute with the sanlock_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep sanlock_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The sanlock_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;sanlock_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the sanlock_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/sanlock</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for sanlock:</p>

<p>sanlock_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a sanlock_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type sanlock_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. sanlock policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run sanlock with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to read/write fuse files,
you must turn on the sanlock_use_fusefs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_fusefs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to manage cifs files, you
must turn on the sanlock_use_samba boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact
with the san- lock, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to manage nfs files, you
must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to read/write fuse files,
you must turn on the sanlock_use_fusefs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_fusefs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to manage cifs files, you
must turn on the sanlock_use_samba boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact
with the san- lock, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sanlock to manage nfs files, you
must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sanlock:</p>

<p>sanlock_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the sanlock_t domain.</p>

<p>sanlock_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the sanlock_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>sanlock_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as sanlock log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>sanlock_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the sanlock files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type sanlock_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>sanlock_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/sanlock.log.*</p>

<p>sanlock_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/sanlock(/.*)?</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>virt_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/oz(/.*)? /var/lib/libvirt(/.*)?</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
