<p>spamd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for spamd
spamd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME spamd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the spamd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the spamd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The spamd processes execute with the spamd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep spamd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The spamd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;spamd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the spamd_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/spamd, /usr/sbin/spamd, /usr/bin/pyzord,
/usr/bin/mimedefang, /usr/bin/mimedefang-multiplexor</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their spamd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamc_t, spamd_t, spamass_milter_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a spamd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type spamd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. spamd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run spamd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow user spamassassin clients to use
the network, you must turn on the spamassassin_can_network
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamassassin_can_network 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow spamd to read/write user home
directories, you must turn on the spamd_enable_home_dirs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamd_enable_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to check spam, you must
turn on the httpd_can_check_spam boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_check_spam 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow user spamassassin clients to use
the network, you must turn on the spamassassin_can_network
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamassassin_can_network 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow spamd to read/write user home
directories, you must turn on the spamd_enable_home_dirs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P spamd_enable_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to check spam, you must
turn on the httpd_can_check_spam boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_check_spam 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their spamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamd_compiled_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_compiled_t type, if you want
to treat the files as spamd compiled data.</p>

<p>spamd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_etc_t type, if you want to
store spamd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>spamd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the spamd_t domain.</p>

<p>spamd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the spamd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>spamd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as spamd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>spamd_spool_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_spool_t type, if you want to
store the spamd files under the /var/spool directory.</p>

<p>spamd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store spamd tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>spamd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the spamd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>spamd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the spamd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their spamd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for spamd:</p>

<p>spamd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 783</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type spamd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
