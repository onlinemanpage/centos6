<p>gpg_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for gpg
gpg_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gpg_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the gpg processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gpg
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The gpg processes execute with the gpg_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep gpg_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The gpg_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;gpg_exec_t&quot; file type. The default entrypoint
paths for the gpg_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/lib(64)?/gnupg/.*, /usr/bin/gpg(2)?,
/usr/bin/kgpg</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gpg policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their gpg processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for gpg:</p>

<p>gpg_t, gpg_pinentry_t, gpg_helper_t, gpg_web_t,
gpg_agent_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a gpg_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type gpg_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. gpg policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run gpg with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow httpd to run gpg in gpg-web domain,
you must turn on the httpd_use_gpg boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_use_gpg 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow usage of the gpg-agent
--write-env-file option. This also allows gpg-agent to
manage user files, you must turn on the gpg_agent_env_file
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_agent_env_file 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow httpd to run gpg in gpg-web domain,
you must turn on the httpd_use_gpg boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_use_gpg 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow usage of the gpg-agent
--write-env-file option. This also allows gpg-agent to
manage user files, you must turn on the gpg_agent_env_file
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_agent_env_file 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow gpg web domain to modify public
files used for public file transfer services, you must turn
on the gpg_web_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_web_anon_write 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow gpg servers to read the /var/gpg directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/gpg(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v /var/gpg</p>

<p>Allow gpg servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming by
adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and by
restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_gpgd_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/gpg/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/gpg/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow gpg web domain to modify public
files used for public file transfer services., you must turn
on the gpg_web_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P gpg_web_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gpg policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gpg processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gpg:</p>

<p>gpg_agent_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_agent_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the gpg_agent_t domain.</p>

<p>gpg_agent_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_agent_tmp_t type, if you want
to store gpg agent temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>gpg_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an exe- cutable to the gpg_t domain.</p>

<p>gpg_helper_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_helper_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the gpg_helper_t domain.</p>

<p>gpg_pinentry_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_pinentry_tmp_t type, if you
want to store gpg pinentry temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>gpg_pinentry_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_pinentry_tmpfs_t type, if you
want to store gpg pinentry files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>gpg_secret_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gpg_secret_t type, if you want to
treat the files as gpg se secret data.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type gpg_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>etc_mail_t</p>

<p>/etc/mail(/.*)?</p>

<p>gpg_agent_tmp_t</p>

<p>gpg_secret_t</p>

<p>/root/.gnupg(/.+)? /home/[^/]*/.gnupg(/.+)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>mozilla_home_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.java(/.*)? /home/[^/]*/.galeon(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.mozilla(/.*)? /home/[^/]*/.phoenix(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.netscape(/.*)?
/home/[^/]*/.thunderbird(/.*)?</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>user_home_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.+</p>

<p>user_tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp/gconfd-.*</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
