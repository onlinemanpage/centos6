<p>drbd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for drbd
drbd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME drbd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the drbd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the drbd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The drbd processes execute with the drbd_t SELinux type.
You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep drbd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The drbd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,drbd_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the drbd_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/lib/ocf/resource./linbit/drbd,
/sbin/drbdadm, /sbin/drbdsetup, all files on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux drbd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their drbd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for drbd:</p>

<p>drbd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a drbd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type drbd_t permissive.
Permissive pro- cess types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux drbd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their drbd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for drbd:</p>

<p>drbd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the drbd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the drbd_t domain.</p>

<p>drbd_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the drbd_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as drbd lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>drbd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the drbd_var_lib_t type, if you want to
store the drbd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type drbd_t can manage
files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The paths
listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the
processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
