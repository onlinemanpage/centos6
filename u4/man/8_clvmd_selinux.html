<p>clvmd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for clvmd
clvmd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME clvmd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the clvmd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clvmd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The clvmd processes execute with the clvmd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep clvmd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The clvmd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,clvmd_exec_t,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the clvmd_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/sbin/clvmd, all files on the
system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux clvmd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their clvmd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for clvmd:</p>

<p>clvmd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a clvmd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type clvmd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux clvmd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their clvmd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for clvmd:</p>

<p>clvmd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clvmd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the clvmd_t domain.</p>

<p>clvmd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clvmd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the clvmd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>clvmd_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clvmd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to
store clvmd files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>clvmd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clvmd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the clvmd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type clvmd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
