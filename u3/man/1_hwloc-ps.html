<p>NAME hwloc-ps - List currently-running processes that
are bound.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS hwloc-ps [options]</p>

<p>OPTIONS -a list all processes, even those that are not
bound to any spe- cific part of the machine.</p>

<p>-p --physical report OS/physical indexes instead of
logical indexes</p>

<p>-l --logical report logical indexes instead of
physical/OS indexes (default)</p>

<p>-c --cpuset show process bindings as cpusets instead of
objects.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION By default, hwloc-ps lists only those
currently-running processes that are bound; it displays
their their identifier, command-line and bind- ing. The
binding may be reported as objects or cpusets. The output is
a plain list. If you wish to annotate the hierarchical
topology with processes so as to see how they are actual
distributed on the machine, you might want to use lstopo
--ps instead (which also only shows pro- cesses that are
bound).</p>

<p>The -a switch can be used to show all processes, if
desired.</p>
