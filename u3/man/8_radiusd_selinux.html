<p>radiusd_selinux(8) radiusd SELinux Policy documentation
radiusd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME radiusd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the radiusd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. radiusd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run radiusd with the tightest
access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow users to login using a radius
serve, you must turn on the authlogin_radius boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P authlogin_radius 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux radiusd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their radiusd processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for radiusd:</p>

<p>radiusd_etc_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_etc_rw_t type, if you want
to treat the files as radiusd etc read/write content.</p>

<p>radiusd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_etc_t type, if you want to
store radiusd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>radiusd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the radiusd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/freeradius,
/etc/cron.(daily|monthly)/radiusd, /usr/sbin/radiusd,
/etc/cron.(daily|weekly|monthly)/freeradius</p>

<p>radiusd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the radiusd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>radiusd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as radiusd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/radacct(/.*)?,
/var/log/radiusd-freeradius(/.*)?, /var/log/radius.log.*,
/var/log/freeradius(/.*)?, /var/log/radwtmp.*,
/var/log/radius(/.*)?, /var/log/radutmp</p>

<p>radiusd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the radiusd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>radiusd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radiusd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the radiusd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/radiusd.pid, /var/run/radiusd(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux radiusd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their radiusd processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for radiusd:</p>

<p>radius_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux radiusd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their radiusd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for radiusd:</p>

<p>radiusd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
