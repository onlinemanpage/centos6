<p>smoltclient_selinSELinux Policy documentation for
smoltcsmoltclient_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME smoltclient_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the smolt- client processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
smoltclient processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The smoltclient processes execute with the smoltclient_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep smoltclient_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The smoltclient_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;smolt- client_exec_t&quot; file type.
The default entrypoint paths for the smolt- client_t domain
are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/share/smolt/client/sendProfile.py</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux smoltclient policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their smoltclient processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
smoltclient:</p>

<p>smoltclient_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a smoltclient_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type smoltclient_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux smoltclient policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their smoltclient processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
smoltclient:</p>

<p>smoltclient_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smoltclient_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the smoltclient_t
domain.</p>

<p>smoltclient_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smoltclient_tmp_t type, if you want
to store smoltclient temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type smoltclient_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>smoltclient_tmp_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
