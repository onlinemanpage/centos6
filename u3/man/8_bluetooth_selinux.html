<p>bluetooth_selinux(8)bluetooth SELinux Policy
documentationbluetooth_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME bluetooth_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the bluetooth processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures bluetooth (Bluetooth
tools and system services) processes via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. blue- tooth policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run bluetooth with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow xguest to use blue tooth device,
you must turn on the xguest_use_bluetooth boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xguest_use_bluetooth 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux bluetooth policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their bluetooth processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for bluetooth:</p>

<p>bluetooth_conf_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_rw_t type, if you
want to treat the files as bluetooth conf read/write
content.</p>

<p>bluetooth_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_t type, if you want
to treat the files as bluetooth configuration data, usually
stored under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>bluetooth_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the bluetooth_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/hcid, /usr/sbin/sdpd, /usr/bin/hidd,
/usr/sbin/blue- toothd, /usr/sbin/hid2hci, /usr/bin/dund,
/usr/sbin/hciattach, /usr/bin/rfcomm</p>

<p>bluetooth_helper_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
bluetooth_helper_t domain.</p>

<p>bluetooth_helper_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmp_t type, if you
want to store bluetooth helper temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t type, if
you want to store bluetooth helper files on a tmpfs file
system.</p>

<p>bluetooth_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
bluetooth_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/bluetooth,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/dund, /etc/rc.d/init.d/pand</p>

<p>bluetooth_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_lock_t type, if you want
to treat the files as bluetooth lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>bluetooth_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_tmp_t type, if you want
to store blue- tooth temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>bluetooth_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the bluetooth files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>bluetooth_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bluetooth_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the bluetooth files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/bluetoothd_address, /var/run/sdp</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux bluetooth policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their blue- tooth processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
bluetooth:</p>

<p>bluetooth_helper_t, bluetooth_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
