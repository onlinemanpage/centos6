<p>mysql_selinux(8) MySQL SELinux Policy documentation
mysql_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME mysql_selinux - Security-Enhanced Linux Policy for
the MySQL daemon</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) secures
the MySQL server via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE_CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type. Policy governs the access
daemons have to these files. SELinux mysql policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their database services in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file contexts types are defined for mysql:
mysqld_db_t - Set database files with mysqld_db_t if you
want mysqld to treat the files as a database.</p>

<p>For example, if you wanted to store your mysqld database
in /database, you would need to setup SELinux labelling for
this directory tree by executing:</p>

<p># semanage fcontext -a -t myqld_db_t /database(/.*)? #
restorecon -R -v /database</p>

<p>PORTS MySQL listens on the 3306/tcp and 3306/udp port by
default. If you need MySQL to be able to listen on a
different port, you need to define that port as being a
mysql_port_t;</p>

<p>For example if you wanted mysqld to be able to listen on
tcp port 3307, you would execute the following:</p>

<p># semanage port -a -t mysql_port_t -p tcp 3307</p>

<p>BOOLEANS MySQL is only allowed to connect to ports
3306/tcp and 3306/udp port by default. If you need MySQL to
be able to connect to other ports, you can either set the
port as a mysql_port_t as defined above or set the
mysql_connect_any boolean to &quot;on&quot;:</p>

<p>setsebool -P mysql_connect_any on</p>

<p>If you want to allow processes running in a user domain
to connect to MySQL, you can set the
allow_user_mysql_connect boolean to &quot;on&quot;:</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_user_mysql_connect on</p>

<p>Note that you can also use the system-config-selinux
utility that allows you to customize SELinux policy settings
in the graphical user interface.</p>
