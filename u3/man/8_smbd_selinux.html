<p>smbd_selinux(8) smbd SELinux Policy documentation
smbd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME smbd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the smbd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SHARING FILES If you want to share files
with multiple domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can
set a file context of public_content_t and public_con-
tent_rw_t. These context allow any of the above domains to
read the content. If you want a particular domain to write
to the public_con- tent_rw_t domain, you must set the
appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow smbd servers to read the /var/smbd directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/smbd(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/smbd</p>

<p>Allow smbd servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming
by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and
by restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_smbd_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/smbd/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/smbd/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to modify public files used
for public file transfer services. Files/Directories must be
labeled public_con- tent_rw_t., you must turn on the
allow_smbd_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_smbd_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux smbd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their smbd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for smbd:</p>

<p>smbd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smbd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the smbd_t domain.</p>

<p>smbd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smbd_keytab_t type, if you want to
treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>smbd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smbd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store smbd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>smbd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the smbd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the smbd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/samba/smbd.pid, /var/run/smbd.pid,
/var/run/samba/lock- ing.tdb, /var/run/samba/share_info.tdb,
/var/run/samba/connec- tions.tdb,
/var/run/samba/gencache.tdb, /var/run/samba/ses- sionid.tdb,
/var/run/samba/brlock.tdb</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux smbd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their smbd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for smbd:</p>

<p>smbd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux smbd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their smbd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for smbd:</p>

<p>smbcontrol_t, smbmount_t, smbd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
