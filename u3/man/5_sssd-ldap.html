<p>SSSD-LDAP(5) File Formats and Conventions
SSSD-LDAP(5)</p>

<p>NAME sssd-ldap - the configuration file for SSSD</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the configuration
of LDAP domains for sssd(8). Refer to the FILE FORMAT
section of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for detailed syntax
information.</p>

<p>You can configure SSSD to use more than one LDAP
domain.</p>

<p>LDAP back end supports id, auth, access and chpass
providers. If you want to authenticate against an LDAP
server either TLS/SSL or LDAPS is required. sssd does not
support authentication over an unencrypted channel. If the
LDAP server is used only as an identity provider, an
encrypted channel is not needed. Please refer to
ldap_access_filter config option for more information about
using LDAP as an access provider.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS All of the common configuration
options that apply to SSSD domains also apply to LDAP
domains. Refer to the DOMAIN SECTIONS section of the
sssd.conf(5) manual page for full details.</p>

<p>ldap_uri (string) Specifies the comma-separated list of
URIs of the LDAP servers to which SSSD should connect in the
order of preference. Refer to the FAILOVER section for more
information on failover and server redundancy. If not
specified, service discovery is enabled. For more
information, refer to the SERVICE DISCOVERY section.</p>

<p>The format of the URI must match the format defined in
RFC 2732:</p>

<p>ldap[s]://&lt;host&gt;[:port]</p>

<p>For explicit IPv6 addresses, &lt;host&gt; must be
enclosed in brackets []</p>

<p>example: ldap://[fc00::126:25]:389</p>

<p>ldap_chpass_uri (string) Specifies the comma-separated
list of URIs of the LDAP servers to which SSSD should
connect in the order of preference to change the password of
a user. Refer to the FAILOVER section for more information
on failover and server redundancy.</p>

<p>To enable service discovery ldap_chpass_dns_service_name
must be set.</p>

<p>Default: empty, i.e. ldap_uri is used.</p>

<p>ldap_search_base (string) The default base DN to use for
performing LDAP user operations.</p>

<p>Starting with SSSD 1.7.0, SSSD supports multiple search
bases using the syntax:</p>


<p>search_base[?scope?[filter][?search_base?scope?[filter]]*]</p>

<p>The scope can be one of &quot;base&quot;,
&quot;onelevel&quot; or &quot;subtree&quot;.</p>

<p>The filter must be a valid LDAP search filter as
specified by http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com (which is
equivalent to) ldap_search_base =
dc=example,dc=com?subtree?</p>

<p>ldap_search_base =
cn=host_specific,dc=example,dc=com?subtree?(host=thishost)?dc=example.com?subtree?</p>

<p>Note: It is unsupported to have multiple search bases
which reference identically-named objects (for example,
groups with the same name in two different search bases).
This will lead to unpredictable behavior on client
machines.</p>

<p>Default: If not set, the value of the
defaultNamingContext or namingContexts attribute from the
RootDSE of the LDAP server is used. If defaultNamingContext
does not exists or has an empty value namingContexts is
used. The namingContexts attribute must have a single value
with the DN of the search base of the LDAP server to make
this work. Multiple values are are not supported.</p>

<p>ldap_schema (string) Specifies the Schema Type in use on
the target LDAP server. Depending on the selected schema,
the default attribute names retrieved from the servers may
vary. The way that some attributes are handled may also
differ. Three schema types are currently supported: rfc2307
rfc2307bis IPA The main difference between these schema
types is how group memberships are recorded in the server.
With rfc2307, group members are listed by name in the
memberUid attribute. With rfc2307bis and IPA, group members
are listed by DN and stored in the member attribute.</p>

<p>Default: rfc2307</p>

<p>ldap_default_bind_dn (string) The default bind DN to use
for performing LDAP operations.</p>

<p>ldap_default_authtok_type (string) The type of the

<p>ldap_user_ssh_public_key (string) The LDAP attribute
that contains the user&acute;s SSH public keys.</p>

<p>ldap_force_upper_case_realm (boolean) Some directory
servers, for example Active Directory, might deliver the
realm part of the UPN in lower case, which might cause the
authentication to fail. Set this option to a non-zero value
if you want to use an upper-case realm.</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ldap_enumeration_refresh_timeout (integer) Specifies how
many seconds SSSD has to wait before refreshing its cache of
enumerated records.</p>

<p>Default: 300</p>

<p>ldap_purge_cache_timeout (integer) Determine how often
to check the cache for inactive entries (such as groups with
no members and users who have never logged in) and remove
them to save space.</p>

<p>Setting this option to zero will disable the cache
cleanup operation.</p>

<p>Default: 10800 (12 hours)</p>

lists the user&acute;s group memberships.</p>

<p>Default: memberOf</p>

<p>ldap_user_authorized_service (string) If
access_provider=ldap and
ldap_access_order=authorized_service, SSSD will use the
presence of the authorizedService attribute in the
user&acute;s LDAP entry to determine access privilege.</p>

<p>An explicit deny (!svc) is resolved first. Second, SSSD
searches for explicit allow (svc) and finally for allow_all
(*).</p>

<p>Default: authorizedService</p>

<p>ldap_user_authorized_host (string) If
access_provider=ldap and ldap_access_order=host, SSSD will
use the presence of the host attribute in the user&acute;s
LDAP entry to determine access privilege.</p>

<p>An explicit deny (!host) is resolved first. Second, SSSD
searches for explicit allow (host) and finally for allow_all
(*).</p>

nesting SSSD will follow. This option has no effect on the
RFC2307 schema.</p>

<p>Default: 2</p>

<p>ldap_netgroup_object_class (string) The object class of
a netgroup entry in LDAP.</p>

<p>In IPA provider, ipa_netgroup_object_class should be
used instead.</p>

<p>Default: nisNetgroup</p>

<p>ldap_netgroup_name (string) The LDAP attribute that
corresponds to the netgroup name.</p>

<p>In IPA provider, ipa_netgroup_name should be used
instead.</p>

<p>Default: cn</p>

<p>ldap_netgroup_member (string) The LDAP attribute that
contains the names of the netgroup&acute;s members.</p>

<p>In IPA provider, ipa_netgroup_member should be used
instead.</p>

contains the name of service attributes and their
aliases.</p>

<p>Default: cn</p>

<p>ldap_service_port (string) The LDAP attribute that
contains the port managed by this service.</p>

<p>Default: ipServicePort</p>

<p>ldap_service_proto (string) The LDAP attribute that
contains the protocols understood by this service.</p>

<p>Default: ipServiceProtocol</p>

<p>ldap_service_search_base (string) An optional base DN to
restrict service searches to a specific subtree.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ldap_search_timeout (integer) Specifies the timeout (in
seconds) that ldap searches are allowed to run before they
are cancelled and cached results are returned (and offline
mode is entered)</p>

<p>Note: this option is subject to change in future
versions of the SSSD. It will likely be replaced at some
point by a series of timeouts for specific lookup types.</p>

<p>Default: 6</p>

<p>ldap_enumeration_search_timeout (integer) Specifies the
timeout (in seconds) that ldap searches for user and group
enumerations are allowed to run before they are cancelled
and cached results are returned (and offline mode is
entered)</p>

<p>Default: 60</p>

<p>ldap_network_timeout (integer) Specifies the timeout (in
seconds) after which the poll(2)/select(2) following a
connect(2) returns in case of no activity.</p>

<p>Default: 6</p>

<p>ldap_opt_timeout (integer) Specifies a timeout (in
seconds) after which calls to synchronous LDAP APIs will
abort if no response is received. Also controls the timeout
when communicating with the KDC in case of SASL bind.</p>

<p>Default: 6</p>

<p>ldap_connection_expire_timeout (integer) Specifies a
timeout (in seconds) that a connection to an LDAP server
will be maintained. After this time, the connection will be
re-established. If used in parallel with SASL/GSSAPI, the
sooner of the two values (this value vs. the TGT lifetime)
will be used.</p>

<p>Default: 900 (15 minutes)</p>

<p>ldap_page_size (integer) Specify the number of records
to retrieve from LDAP in a single request. Some LDAP servers
enforce a maximum limit per-request.</p>

<p>Default: 1000</p>

<p>ldap_disable_paging Disable the LDAP paging control.
This option should be used if the LDAP server reports that
it supports the LDAP paging control in its RootDSE but it is
not enabled or does not behave properly.</p>

<p>Example: OpenLDAP servers with the paging control module
installed on the server but not enabled will report it in
the RootDSE but be unable to use it.</p>

<p>Example: 389 DS has a bug where it can only support a
one paging control at a time on a single connection. On busy
clients, this can result in some requests being denied.</p>

<p>ldap_deref_threshold (integer) Specify the number of
group members that must be missing from the internal cache
in order to trigger a dereference lookup. If less members
are missing, they are looked up individually.</p>

<p>You can turn off dereference lookups completely by
setting the value to 0.</p>

<p>A dereference lookup is a means of fetching all group
members in a single LDAP call. Different LDAP servers may
implement different dereference methods. The currently
supported servers are 389/RHDS, OpenLDAP and Active
Directory.</p>

<p>Note: If any of the search bases specifies a search
filter, then the dereference lookup performance enhancement
will be disabled regardless of this setting.</p>

<p>Default: 10</p>

<p>ldap_tls_reqcert (string) Specifies what checks to
perform on server certificates in a TLS session, if any. It
can be specified as one of the following values:</p>

<p>never = The client will not request or check any server
certificate.</p>

<p>allow = The server certificate is requested. If no
certificate is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a
bad certificate is provided, it will be ignored and the
session proceeds normally.</p>

<p>try = The server certificate is requested. If no
certificate is provided, the session proceeds normally. If a
bad certificate is provided, the session is immediately
terminated.</p>

<p>demand = The server certificate is requested. If no
certificate is provided, or a bad certificate is provided,
the session is immediately terminated.</p>

<p>hard = Same as demand</p>

<p>Default: hard</p>

<p>ldap_tls_cacert (string) Specifies the file that
contains certificates for all of the Certificate Authorities
that sssd will recognize.</p>

<p>Default: use OpenLDAP defaults, typically in
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</p>

<p>ldap_tls_cacertdir (string) Specifies the path of a
directory that contains Certificate Authority certificates
in separate individual files. Typically the file names need
to be the hash of the certificate followed by
&acute;.0&acute;. If available, cacertdir_rehash can be used
to create the correct names.</p>

<p>Default: use OpenLDAP defaults, typically in
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</p>

<p>ldap_tls_cert (string) Specifies the file that contains
the certificate for the client&acute;s key.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>ldap_tls_key (string) Specifies the file that contains
the client&acute;s key.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>ldap_tls_cipher_suite (string) Specifies acceptable
cipher suites. Typically this is a colon sperated list. See
ldap.conf(5) for format.</p>

<p>Default: use OpenLDAP defaults, typically in
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</p>

<p>ldap_id_use_start_tls (boolean) Specifies that the
id_provider connection must also use tls to protect the
channel.</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ldap_sasl_mech (string) Specify the SASL mechanism to
use. Currently only GSSAPI is tested and supported.</p>

<p>Default: none</p>

<p>ldap_sasl_authid (string) Specify the SASL authorization
id to use. When GSSAPI is used, this represents the Kerberos
principal used for authentication to the directory.</p>

<p>Default: host/machine.fqdn@REALM</p>

<p>ldap_sasl_canonicalize (boolean) If set to true, the
LDAP library would perform a reverse lookup to canonicalize
the host name during a SASL bind.</p>

<p>Default: false;</p>

<p>ldap_krb5_keytab (string) Specify the keytab to use when
using SASL/GSSAPI.</p>

<p>Default: System keytab, normally /etc/krb5.keytab</p>

<p>ldap_krb5_init_creds (boolean) Specifies that the
id_provider should init Kerberos credentials (TGT). This
action is performed only if SASL is used and the mechanism
selected is GSSAPI.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>ldap_krb5_ticket_lifetime (integer) Specifies the
lifetime in seconds of the TGT if GSSAPI is used.</p>

<p>Default: 86400 (24 hours)</p>

<p>krb5_server (string) Specifies the comma-separated list
of IP addresses or hostnames of the Kerberos servers to
which SSSD should connect in the order of preference. For
more information on failover and server redundancy, see the
FAILOVER section. An optional port number (preceded by a
colon) may be appended to the addresses or hostnames. If
empty, service discovery is enabled - for more information,
refer to the SERVICE DISCOVERY section.</p>

<p>When using service discovery for KDC or kpasswd servers,
SSSD first searches for DNS entries that specify _udp as the
protocol and falls back to _tcp if none are found.</p>

<p>This option was named krb5_kdcip in earlier releases of
SSSD. While the legacy name is recognized for the time
being, users are advised to migrate their config files to
use krb5_server instead.</p>

<p>krb5_realm (string) Specify the Kerberos REALM (for
SASL/GSSAPI auth).</p>

<p>Default: System defaults, see /etc/krb5.conf</p>

<p>krb5_canonicalize (boolean) Specifies if the host
principal should be canonicalized when connecting to LDAP
server. This feature is available with MIT Kerberos &gt;=
1.7</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>ldap_pwd_policy (string) Select the policy to evaluate
the password expiration on the client side. The following
values are allowed:</p>

<p>none - No evaluation on the client side. This option
cannot disable server-side password policies.</p>

<p>shadow - Use shadow(5) style attributes to evaluate if
the password has expired.</p>

<p>mit_kerberos - Use the attributes used by MIT Kerberos
to determine if the password has expired. Use
chpass_provider=krb5 to update these attributes when the
password is changed.</p>

<p>Default: none</p>

<p>ldap_referrals (boolean) Specifies whether automatic
referral chasing should be enabled.</p>

<p>Please note that sssd only supports referral chasing
when it is compiled with OpenLDAP version 2.4.13 or
higher.</p>

<p>Default: true</p>

<p>ldap_dns_service_name (string) Specifies the service
name to use when service discovery is enabled.</p>

<p>Default: ldap</p>

<p>ldap_chpass_dns_service_name (string) Specifies the
service name to use to find an LDAP server which allows
password changes when service discovery is enabled.</p>

<p>Default: not set, i.e. service discovery is disabled</p>

<p>ldap_access_filter (string) If using access_provider =
ldap, this option is mandatory. It specifies an LDAP search
filter criteria that must be met for the user to be granted
access on this host. If access_provider = ldap and this
option is not set, it will result in all users being denied
access. Use access_provider = allow to change this default
behavior.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>access_provider = ldap ldap_access_filter =
memberOf=cn=allowedusers,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com</p>

<p>This example means that access to this host is
restricted to members of the &quot;allowedusers&quot; group
in ldap.</p>

<p>Offline caching for this feature is limited to
determining whether the user&acute;s last online login was
granted access permission. If they were granted access
during their last login, they will continue to be granted
access while offline and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Default: Empty</p>

<p>ldap_account_expire_policy (string) With this option a
client side evaluation of access control attributes can be
enabled.</p>

<p>Please note that it is always recommended to use server
side access control, i.e. the LDAP server should deny the
bind request with a suitable error code even if the password
is correct.</p>

<p>The following values are allowed:</p>

<p>shadow: use the value of ldap_user_shadow_expire to
determine if the account is expired.</p>

<p>ad: use the value of the 32bit field
ldap_user_ad_user_account_control and allow access if the
second bit is not set. If the attribute is missing access is
granted. Also the expiration time of the account is
checked.</p>

<p>rhds, ipa, 389ds: use the value of ldap_ns_account_lock
to check if access is allowed or not.</p>

<p>nds: the values of ldap_user_nds_login_allowed_time_map,
ldap_user_nds_login_disabled and
ldap_user_nds_login_expiration_time are used to check if
access is allowed. If both attributes are missing access is
granted. This is an experimental feature, please use
http://fedorahosted.org/sssd to report any issues.</p>

<p>Default: Empty</p>

<p>ldap_access_order (string) Comma separated list of
access control options. Allowed values are:</p>

<p>filter: use ldap_access_filter</p>

<p>expire: use ldap_account_expire_policy</p>

<p>authorized_service: use the authorizedService attribute
to determine access</p>

<p>host: use the host attribute to determine access</p>

<p>Default: filter</p>

<p>Please note that it is a configuration error if a value
is used more than once.</p>

<p>ldap_deref (string) Specifies how alias dereferencing is
done when performing a search. The following options are
allowed:</p>

<p>never: Aliases are never dereferenced.</p>

<p>searching: Aliases are dereferenced in subordinates of
the base object, but not in locating the base object of the
search.</p>

<p>finding: Aliases are only dereferenced when locating the
base object of the search.</p>

<p>always: Aliases are dereferenced both in searching and
in locating the base object of the search.</p>

<p>Default: Empty (this is handled as never by the LDAP
client libraries)</p>

<p>AUTOFS OPTIONS Please note that the default values
correspond to the default schema which is RFC2307.</p>

<p>This is an experimental feature, please use
http://fedorahosted.org/sssd to report any issues.</p>

<p>ldap_autofs_map_object_class (string) The object class
of an automount map entry in LDAP.</p>

<p>Default: automountMap</p>

point.</p>

<p>Default: cn</p>

<p>ldap_autofs_entry_value (string) The key of an automount
entry in LDAP. The entry usually corresponds to a mount
point.</p>

<p>Default: automountInformation</p>

<p>ADVANCED OPTIONS These options are supported by LDAP
domains, but they should be used with caution. Please
include them in your configuration only if you know what you
are doing.</p>

<p>ldap_netgroup_search_base (string) An optional base DN
to restrict netgroup searches to a specific subtree.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ldap_user_search_base (string) An optional base DN to
restrict user searches to a specific subtree.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ldap_group_search_base (string) An optional base DN to
restrict group searches to a specific subtree.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>ldap_user_search_filter (string) This option specifies
an additional LDAP search filter criteria that restrict user
searches.</p>

<p>This option is deprecated in favor of the syntax used by
ldap_user_search_base.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ldap_user_search_filter = (loginShell=/bin/tcsh)</p>

<p>This filter would restrict user searches to users that
have their shell set to /bin/tcsh.</p>

<p>ldap_group_search_filter (string) This option specifies
an additional LDAP search filter criteria that restrict
group searches.</p>

<p>This option is deprecated in favor of the syntax used by
ldap_group_search_base.</p>

<p>Default: not set</p>

<p>ldap_autofs_search_base (string) An optional base DN to
restrict automounter searches to a specific subtree.</p>

<p>See ldap_search_base for information about configuring
multiple search bases.</p>

<p>Default: the value of ldap_search_base</p>

<p>This is an experimental feature, please use
http://fedorahosted.org/sssd to report any issues.</p>

<p>FAILOVER The failover feature allows back ends to
automatically switch to a different server if the primary
server fails.</p>

<p>Failover Syntax The list of servers is given as a
comma-separated list; any number of spaces is allowed around
the comma. The servers are listed in order of preference.
The list can contain any number of servers.</p>

<p>The Failover Mechanism The failover mechanism
distinguishes between a machine and a service. The back end
first tries to resolve the hostname of a given machine; if
this resolution attempt fails, the machine is considered
offline. No further attempts are made to connect to this
machine for any other service. If the resolution attempt
succeeds, the back end tries to connect to a service on this
machine. If the service connection attempt fails, then only
this particular service is considered offline and the back
end automatically switches over to the next service. The
machine is still considered online and might still be tried
for another service.</p>

<p>Further connection attempts are made to machines or
services marked as offline after a specified period of time;
this is currently hard coded to 30 seconds.</p>

<p>If there are no more machines to try, the back end as a
whole switches to offline mode, and then attempts to
reconnect every 30 seconds.</p>

<p>SERVICE DISCOVERY The service discovery feature allows
back ends to automatically find the appropriate servers to
connect to using a special DNS query.</p>

<p>Configuration If no servers are specified, the back end
automatically uses service discovery to try to find a
server. Optionally, the user may choose to use both fixed
server addresses and service discovery by inserting a
special keyword, _srv_, in the list of servers. The order of
preference is maintained. This feature is useful if, for
example, the user prefers to use service discovery whenever
possible, and fall back to a specific server when no servers
can be discovered using DNS.</p>

<p>The domain name Please refer to the dns_discovery_domain
parameter in the sssd.conf(5) manual page for more
details.</p>

<p>The protocol The queries usually specify _tcp as the
protocol. Exceptions are documented in respective option
description.</p>

<p>See Also For more information on the service discovery
mechanism, refer to RFC 2782.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example assumes that SSSD is
correctly configured and LDAP is set to one of the domains
in the [domains] section.</p>

<p>[domain/LDAP] id_provider = ldap auth_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://ldap.mydomain.org ldap_search_base =
dc=mydomain,dc=org ldap_tls_reqcert = demand
cache_credentials = true enumerate = true</p>

<p>NOTES The descriptions of some of the configuration
options in this manual page are based on the ldap.conf(5)
manual page from the OpenLDAP 2.4 distribution.</p>
