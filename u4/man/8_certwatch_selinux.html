<p>certwatch_selinux(SELinux Policy documentation for
certwatcertwatch_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME certwatch_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the certwatch processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
certwatch processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The certwatch processes execute with the certwatch_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep certwatch_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The certwatch_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;certwatch_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the certwatch_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/certwatch</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux certwatch policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cert- watch processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
certwatch:</p>

<p>certwatch_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a certwatch_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type certwatch_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux certwatch policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their certwatch processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for certwatch:</p>

<p>certwatch_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the certwatch_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the certwatch_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type certwatch_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>auth_cache_t</p>

<p>/var/cache/coolkey(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
