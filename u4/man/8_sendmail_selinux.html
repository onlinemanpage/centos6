<p>sendmail_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
sendmaisendmail_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sendmail_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the sendmail pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sendmail
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The sendmail processes execute with the sendmail_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep sendmail_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The sendmail_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;send- mail_exec_t,mta_exec_type&quot; file
types. The default entrypoint paths for the sendmail_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/lib(64)?/sendmail, /bin/mail(x)?,
/usr/sbin/sendmail(.sendmail)?, /usr/bin/esmtp,
/usr/sbin/ssmtp, /usr/sbin/rmail, /var/qmail/bin/send- mail,
/usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix,
/usr/lib/courier/bin/sendmail</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sendmail policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sendmail processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
sendmail:</p>

<p>sendmail_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a sendmail_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type sendmail_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. send- mail policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run sendmail with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to send mail, you must
turn on the httpd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you
must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow http daemon to send mail, you must
turn on the httpd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you
must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sendmail policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their sendmail processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sendmail:</p>

<p>sendmail_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the sendmail_t domain.</p>

<p>sendmail_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the sendmail_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>sendmail_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_keytab_t type, if you want
to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>sendmail_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as sendmail log data, usually stored under
the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>sendmail_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_tmp_t type, if you want to
store sendmail temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>sendmail_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sendmail_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the sendmail files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type sendmail_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>anon_inodefs_t</p>

<p>dovecot_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/dovecot(/.*)?</p>

<p>etc_aliases_t</p>

<p>/etc/postfix/aliases.* /etc/aliases /etc/aliases.db
/etc/mail/aliases /etc/mail/aliases.db</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mail_home_rw_t</p>

<p>/root/Maildir(/.*)? /home/[^/]*/Maildir(/.*)?</p>

<p>mail_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/mail(/.*)? /var/spool/imap(/.*)?
/var/spool/mail(/.*)?</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>mqueue_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/(client)?mqueue(/.*)?</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>procmail_tmp_t</p>

<p>sendmail_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/mail(/.*)? /var/log/sendmail.st.*</p>

<p>sendmail_tmp_t</p>

<p>sendmail_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/sendmail.pid /var/run/sm-client.pid</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>user_home_t</p>

<p>/home/[^/]*/.+</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
