<p>cfengine_selinux(8) cfengine SELinux Policy
documentation cfengine_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME cfengine_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the cfengine pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures cfengine (policy for
cfengine) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cfengine policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cfengine processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for cfengine:</p>

<p>cfengine_execd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_execd_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the cfengine_execd_t
domain.</p>

<p>cfengine_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the cfengine_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/rc.d/init.d/cf-serverd,
/etc/rc.d/init.d/cf-execd, /etc/rc.d/init.d/cf-monitord</p>

<p>cfengine_monitord_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_monitord_exec_t type, if
you want to transition an executable to the
cfengine_monitord_t domain.</p>

<p>cfengine_serverd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_serverd_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
cfengine_serverd_t domain.</p>

<p>cfengine_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the cfengine files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cfengine policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their cfengine processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cfengine:</p>

<p>cfengine_execd_t, cfengine_monitord_t,
cfengine_serverd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
