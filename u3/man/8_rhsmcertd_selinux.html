<p>rhsmcertd_selinux(8)rhsmcertd SELinux Policy
documentationrhsmcertd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME rhsmcertd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the rhsmcertd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures rhsmcertd
(Subscription Management Certificate Daemon policy)
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux rhsmcertd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their rhsmcertd processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for rhsmcertd:</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the rhsmcertd_t domain.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
rhsmcertd_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_lock_t type, if you want
to treat the files as rhsmcertd lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_log_t type, if you want
to treat the data as rhsmcertd log data, usually stored
under the /var/log direc- tory.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the rhsmcertd files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rhsmcertd_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the rhsmcertd files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux rhsmcertd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rhsm- certd processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
rhsmcertd:</p>

<p>rhsmcertd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
