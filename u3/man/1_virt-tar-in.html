<p>virt-tar-in(1) Virtualization Support virt-tar-in(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-tar-in - Unpack a tarball into a virtual
machine disk image.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-tar-in -a disk.img data.tar
/destination</p>

<p>virt-tar-in -d domain data.tar /destination</p>

<p>zcat data.tar.gz | virt-tar-in -d domain -
/destination</p>

<p>WARNING Using &quot;virt-tar-in&quot; on live virtual
machines can be dangerous, potentially causing disk
corruption. The virtual machine must be shut down before you
use this command.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-tar-in&quot; unpacks an
uncompressed tarball into a virtual machine disk image or
named libvirt domain.</p>

<p>The first parameter is the tar file. Use &quot;-&quot;
to read the tar file from standard input. The second
parameter is the absolute target directory to unpack
into.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Upload a home directory to a guest:</p>

<p>virt-tar-in -d MyGuest homes.tar /home</p>

<p>JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH This
command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
guestfish(1) &quot;tar-in&quot; command. For anything more
complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off
using guestfish directly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Since the shell script just passes options
straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full
list of options.</p>
