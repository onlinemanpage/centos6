<p>avahi_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for avahi
avahi_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME avahi_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the avahi processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the avahi
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The avahi processes execute with the avahi_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep avahi_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The avahi_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;avahi_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the avahi_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/avahi-daemon, /usr/sbin/avahi-autoipd,
/usr/sbin/avahi- dnsconfd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux avahi policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their avahi pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for avahi:</p>

<p>avahi_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a avahi_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type avahi_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. avahi policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run avahi with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow Apache to communicate with avahi
service via dbus, you must turn on the httpd_dbus_avahi
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_dbus_avahi 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Apache to communicate with avahi
service via dbus, you must turn on the httpd_dbus_avahi
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_dbus_avahi 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux avahi policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their avahi processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for avahi:</p>

<p>avahi_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the avahi_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the avahi_t domain.</p>

<p>avahi_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the avahi_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the avahi_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>avahi_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the avahi_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the avahi files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>avahi_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the avahi_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the avahi files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type avahi_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>avahi_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/avahi-autoipd(/.*)?</p>

<p>avahi_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/avahi-daemon(/.*)?</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>net_conf_t</p>

<p>/etc/ntpd?.conf.* /etc/yp.conf.* /etc/denyhosts.*
/etc/hosts.deny.* /etc/resolv.conf.* /etc/ntp/step-tickers.*
/etc/sysconfig/networking(/.*)?
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts(/.*)?
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/.*resolv.conf /etc/hosts
/etc/ethers</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
