<p>bcfg2_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for bcfg2
bcfg2_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME bcfg2_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the bcfg2 processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the bcfg2
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The bcfg2 processes execute with the bcfg2_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep bcfg2_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The bcfg2_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type,bcfg2_exec_t&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the bcfg2_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/usr/sbin/bcfg2-server</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux bcfg2 policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their bcfg2 pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for bcfg2:</p>

<p>bcfg2_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a bcfg2_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type bcfg2_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux bcfg2 policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their bcfg2 processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for bcfg2:</p>

<p>bcfg2_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bcfg2_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the bcfg2_t domain.</p>

<p>bcfg2_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bcfg2_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the bcfg2_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>bcfg2_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bcfg2_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the bcfg2 files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>bcfg2_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bcfg2_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the bcfg2 files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type bcfg2_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
