<p>xserver_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
xserver xserver_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME xserver_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the xserver pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the xserver
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The xserver processes execute with the xserver_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep xserver_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The xserver_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,xserver_exec_t,file_type&quot;
file types. The default entrypoint paths for the xserver_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/bin/Xair, /usr/bin/Xorg,
/usr/bin/Xephyr, /usr/X11R6/bin/X, /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg,
/usr/X11R6/bin/Xipaq, /usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86,
/usr/X11R6/bin/Xwrapper, /etc/init.d/xfree86-common, all
files on the system</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux xserver policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xserver processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for xserver:</p>

<p>xserver_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a xserver_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type xserver_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. xserver policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run xserver with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virtual machine to interact with
the xserver, you must turn on the virt_use_xserver
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_xserver 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows XServer to execute writable
memory, you must turn on the allow_xserver_execmem
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_xserver_execmem 1</p>

<p>If you want to support X userspace object manager, you
must turn on the xserver_object_manager boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xserver_object_manager 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow virtual machine to interact with
the xserver, you must turn on the virt_use_xserver
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_xserver 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows XServer to execute writable
memory, you must turn on the allow_xserver_execmem
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_xserver_execmem 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux xserver policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their xserver processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for xserver:</p>

<p>xserver_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xserver_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the xserver_t domain.</p>

<p>xserver_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xserver_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as xserver log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>xserver_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xserver_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store xserver files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>xserver_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xserver_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the xserver files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>xserver_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xserver_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the xserver files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux xserver policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their xserver processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for xserver:</p>

<p>xserver_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 6000-6150</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type xserver_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
