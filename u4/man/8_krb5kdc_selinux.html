<p>krb5kdc_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
krb5kdc krb5kdc_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME krb5kdc_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the krb5kdc pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the krb5kdc
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The krb5kdc processes execute with the krb5kdc_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep krb5kdc_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The krb5kdc_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;krb5kdc_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the krb5kdc_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/(local/)?(kerberos/)?sbin/krb5kdc</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux krb5kdc policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their krb5kdc processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for krb5kdc:</p>

<p>krb5kdc_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a krb5kdc_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type krb5kdc_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux krb5kdc policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their krb5kdc processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for krb5kdc:</p>

<p>krb5kdc_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as krb5kdc configuration data, usually
stored under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>krb5kdc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the krb5kdc_t domain.</p>

<p>krb5kdc_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as krb5kdc lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>krb5kdc_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as krb5kdc log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>krb5kdc_principal_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_principal_t type, if you
want to treat the files as krb5kdc principal data.</p>

<p>krb5kdc_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_tmp_t type, if you want to
store krb5kdc temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>krb5kdc_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the krb5kdc_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the krb5kdc files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type krb5kdc_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>anon_inodefs_t</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>krb5kdc_lock_t</p>

<p>/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/principal.*.ok
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/from_master.*</p>

<p>krb5kdc_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/krb5kdc.log.*</p>

<p>krb5kdc_principal_t</p>

<p>/etc/krb5kdc/principal.*
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/principal.*
/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/principal.*</p>

<p>krb5kdc_tmp_t</p>

<p>krb5kdc_var_run_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>security_t</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
