<p>rgmanager_selinux(8)rgmanager SELinux Policy
documentationrgmanager_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME rgmanager_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the rgmanager processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures rgmanager (SELinux
policy for rgmanager) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. rgman- ager policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run rgmanager with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow rgmanager domain to connect to the
network using TCP, you must turn on the
rgmanager_can_network_connect boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rgmanager_can_network_connect 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux rgmanager policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their rgmanager processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for rgmanager:</p>

<p>rgmanager_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the rgmanager_t domain.</p>

<p>rgmanager_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_initrc_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
rgmanager_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>rgmanager_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_tmp_t type, if you want
to store rgman- ager temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>rgmanager_tmpfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_tmpfs_t type, if you want
to store rgmanager files on a tmpfs file system.</p>

<p>rgmanager_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_var_log_t type, if you
want to treat the data as rgmanager var log data, usually
stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>rgmanager_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rgmanager_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the rgmanager files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/rgmanager.pid,
/var/run/cluster/rgmanager.sk</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux rgmanager policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rgman- ager processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
rgmanager:</p>

<p>rgmanager_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
