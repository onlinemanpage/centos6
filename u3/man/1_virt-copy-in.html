<p>virt-copy-in(1) Virtualization Support
virt-copy-in(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-copy-in - Copy files and directories into a
virtual machine disk image.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-copy-in -a disk.img file|dir [file|dir
...] /destination</p>

<p>virt-copy-in -d domain file|dir [file|dir ...]
/destination</p>

<p>WARNING Using &quot;virt-copy-in&quot; on live virtual
machines can be dangerous, potentially causing disk
corruption. The virtual machine must be shut down before you
use this command.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION &quot;virt-copy-in&quot; copies files and
directories from the local disk into a virtual machine disk
image or named libvirt domain.</p>

<p>You can give one of more filenames and directories on
the command line. Directories are copied in recursively. The
final parameter must be the destination directory in the
disk image which must be an absolute path starting with a
&quot;/&quot; character.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES Update &quot;/etc/resolv.conf&quot; in a
guest:</p>

<p>virt-copy-in -d MyGuest resolv.conf /etc</p>

<p>Upload a home directory to a guest:</p>

<p>virt-copy-in -d MyGuest skel /home</p>

<p>JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH This
command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
guestfish(1) &quot;copy-in&quot; command. For anything more
complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off
using guestfish directly.</p>

<p>OPTIONS Since the shell script just passes options
straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full
list of options.</p>
