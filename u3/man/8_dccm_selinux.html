<p>dccm_selinux(8) dccm SELinux Policy documentation
dccm_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME dccm_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the dccm processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux dccm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their dccm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for dccm:</p>

<p>dccm_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the dccm_t domain.</p>

<p>dccm_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_tmp_t type, if you want to
store dccm tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>dccm_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the dccm_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the dccm files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux dccm policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their dccm processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for dccm:</p>

<p>dccm_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux dccm policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their dccm pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for dccm:</p>

<p>dccm_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
