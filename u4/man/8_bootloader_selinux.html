<p>bootloader_selinuxSELinux Policy documentation for

<p>NAME bootloader_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the bootloader processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
bootloader processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The bootloader processes execute with the bootloader_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps command with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep bootloader_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The bootloader_t SELinux type can be entered
via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type,bootloader_exec_t&quot; file types. The
default entry- point paths for the bootloader_t domain are
the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system, /sbin/lilo.*,
/sbin/ybin.*, /sbin/zipl, /sbin/grub, /usr/sbin/grub</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux bootloader policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their boot- loader processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
bootloader:</p>

<p>bootloader_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a bootloader_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type bootloader_t
permissive. Permis- sive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. boot- loader policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run bootloader with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allows xdm to execute bootloader, you
must turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows xdm to execute bootloader, you
must turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux bootloader policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their bootloader processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for bootloader:</p>

<p>bootloader_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_etc_t type, if you want
to store boot- loader files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>bootloader_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the bootloader_t domain.</p>

<p>bootloader_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_tmp_t type, if you want
to store boot- loader temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type bootloader_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
