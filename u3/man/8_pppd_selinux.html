<p>pppd_selinux(8) pppd SELinux Policy documentation
pppd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME pppd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the pppd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. pppd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run pppd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow pppd to be run for a regular use,
you must turn on the pppd_for_user boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P pppd_for_user 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow pppd to load kernel modules for
certain modem, you must turn on the pppd_can_insmod
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P pppd_can_insmod 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux pppd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their pppd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for pppd:</p>

<p>pppd_etc_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_etc_rw_t type, if you want to
treat the files as pppd etc read/write content.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/ppp(/.*)?, /etc/ppp/resolv.conf,
/etc/ppp/peers(/.*)?</p>

<p>pppd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_etc_t type, if you want to
store pppd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /root/.ppprc, /etc/ppp</p>

<p>pppd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the pppd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/pppd, /usr/sbin/ipppd, /sbin/ppp-watch,
/sbin/pppoe- server</p>

<p>pppd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the pppd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/ppp/(auth|ip(v6|x)?)-(up|down),
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ppp</p>

<p>pppd_lock_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_lock_t type, if you want to
treat the files as pppd lock data, stored under the
/var/lock directory</p>

<p>pppd_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as pppd log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/ppp/.*,
/var/log/ppp-connect-errors.*</p>

<p>pppd_secret_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_secret_t type, if you want to
treat the files as pppd se secret data.</p>

<p>pppd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store pppd tempo- rary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>pppd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the pppd_var_run_t type, if you want to
store the pppd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/pppd[0-9]*.tdb, /var/run/ppp(/.*)?,
/var/run/(i)?ppp.*pid[^/]*</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux pppd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their pppd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for pppd:</p>

<p>pppd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
