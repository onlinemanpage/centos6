<p>NAME SELinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an
implementation of a flexi- ble mandatory access control
architecture in the Linux operating sys- tem. The SELinux
architecture provides general support for the enforcement of
many kinds of mandatory access control policies, includ- ing
those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement&reg;, Role-
Based Access Control, and Multi-Level Security. Background
information and technical documentation about SELinux can be
found at http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux.</p>

<p>The /etc/selinux/config configuration file controls
whether SELinux is enabled or disabled, and if enabled,
whether SELinux operates in per- missive mode or enforcing
mode. The SELINUX variable may be set to any one of
disabled, permissive, or enforcing to select one of these
options. The disabled option completely disables the SELinux
kernel and application code, leaving the system running
without any SELinux protection. The permissive option
enables the SELinux code, but causes it to operate in a mode
where accesses that would be denied by policy are permitted
but audited. The enforcing option enables the SELinux code
and causes it to enforce access denials as well as auditing
them. Permissive mode may yield a different set of denials
than enforcing mode, both because enforcing mode will
prevent an operation from pro- ceeding past the first denial
and because some application code will fall back to a less
privileged mode of operation if denied access.</p>

<p>The /etc/selinux/config configuration file also controls
what policy is active on the system. SELinux allows for
multiple policies to be installed on the system, but only
one policy may be active at any given time. At present,
multiple kinds of SELinux policy exist: targeted, mls for
example. The targeted policy is designed as a policy where
most user processes operate without restrictions, and only
specific services are placed into distinct security domains
that are confined by the policy. For example, the user would
run in a completely unconfined domain while the named daemon
or apache daemon would run in a specific domain tailored to
its operation. The MLS (Multi-Level Security) pol- icy is
designed as a policy where all processes are partitioned
into fine-grained security domains and confined by policy.
MLS also sup- ports the Bell And LaPadula model, where
processes are not only con- fined by the type but also the
level of the data.</p>

<p>You can define which policy you will run by setting the
SELINUXTYPE environment variable within /etc/selinux/config.
You must reboot and possibly relabel if you change the
policy type to have it take effect on the system. The
corresponding policy configuration for each such policy must
be installed in the /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/ directo-
ries.</p>

<p>A given SELinux policy can be customized further based
on a set of com- pile-time tunable options and a set of
runtime policy booleans. system-config-selinux allows
customization of these booleans and tun- ables.</p>

<p>Many domains that are protected by SELinux also include
SELinux man pages explaining how to customize their
policy.</p>

<p>FILE LABELING All files, directories, devices ... have a
security context/label asso- ciated with them. These context
are stored in the extended attributes of the file system.
Problems with SELinux often arise from the file system being
mislabeled. This can be caused by booting the machine with a
non SELinux kernel. If you see an error message containing
file_t, that is usually a good indicator that you have a
serious problem with file system labeling.</p>

<p>The best way to relabel the file system is to create the
flag file /.autorelabel and reboot. system-config-selinux,
also has this capa- bility. The restorecon/fixfiles commands
are also available for rela- beling files.</p>

<p>Every confined service on the system has a man page in
the following format:</p>

<p>&lt;servicename&gt;_selinux(8)</p>

<p>For example, httpd has the httpd_selinux(8) man
page.</p>

<p>man -k selinux</p>

<p>Will list all SELinux man pages.</p>
