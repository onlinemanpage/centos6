<p>ldconfig_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
ldconfildconfig_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ldconfig_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the ldconfig pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ldconfig
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The ldconfig processes execute with the ldconfig_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep ldconfig_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The ldconfig_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,file_type,ldcon-
fig_exec_t&quot; file types. The default entrypoint paths
for the ldcon- fig_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/sbin/ldconfig</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ldconfig policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ldconfig processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
ldconfig:</p>

<p>ldconfig_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a ldconfig_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type ldconfig_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ldconfig policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their ldconfig processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ldconfig:</p>

<p>ldconfig_cache_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ldconfig_cache_t type, if you want
to store the files under the /var/cache directory.</p>

<p>ldconfig_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ldconfig_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the ldconfig_t domain.</p>

<p>ldconfig_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ldconfig_tmp_t type, if you want to
store ldconfig temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type ldconfig_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
