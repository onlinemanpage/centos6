<p>xenstored_selinux(8)xenstored SELinux Policy
documentationxenstored_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME xenstored_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the xenstored processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux xenstored policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their xenstored processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for xenstored:</p>

<p>xenstored_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xenstored_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the xenstored_t domain.</p>

<p>xenstored_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xenstored_tmp_t type, if you want
to store xen- stored temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>xenstored_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xenstored_var_lib_t type, if you
want to store the xenstored files under the /var/lib
directory.</p>

<p>xenstored_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xenstored_var_log_t type, if you
want to treat the data as xenstored var log data, usually
stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>xenstored_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the xenstored_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the xenstored files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/xenstore.pid,
/var/run/xenstored(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux xenstored policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their xen- stored processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
xenstored:</p>

<p>xenstored_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
