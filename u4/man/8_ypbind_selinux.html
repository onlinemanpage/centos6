<p>ypbind_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
ypbind ypbind_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME ypbind_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the ypbind pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ypbind
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The ypbind processes execute with the ypbind_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep ypbind_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The ypbind_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;ypbind_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the ypbind_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/sbin/ypbind, /usr/sbin/ypbind</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux ypbind policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their ypbind processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for ypbind:</p>

<p>ypbind_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a ypbind_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type ypbind_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. ypbind policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run ypbind with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must
turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux ypbind policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their ypbind processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for ypbind:</p>

<p>ypbind_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ypbind_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the ypbind_t domain.</p>

<p>ypbind_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ypbind_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the ypbind_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>ypbind_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ypbind_tmp_t type, if you want to
store ypbind temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>ypbind_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the ypbind_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the ypbind files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type ypbind_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>var_yp_t</p>

<p>/var/yp(/.*)?</p>

<p>ypbind_tmp_t</p>

<p>ypbind_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/ypbind.*</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
