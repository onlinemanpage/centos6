<p>stunnel_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
stunnel stunnel_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME stunnel_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the stunnel pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the stunnel
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The stunnel processes execute with the stunnel_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep stunnel_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The stunnel_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;stunnel_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the stunnel_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/stunnel, /usr/sbin/stunnel</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a stunnel_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type stunnel_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_etc_t type, if you want to
store stunnel files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>stunnel_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the stunnel_t domain.</p>

<p>stunnel_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_tmp_t type, if you want to
store stunnel temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>stunnel_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the stunnel files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_port_t</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES</p>

<p>The SELinux process type stunnel_t can manage files
labeled with the following file types. The paths listed are
the default paths for these file types. Note the processes
UID still need to have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>stunnel_tmp_t</p>

<p>stunnel_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/stunnel(/.*)?</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
