<p>sge_job_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
sge_job sge_job_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sge_job_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the sge_job pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sge_job
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The sge_job processes execute with the sge_job_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep sge_job_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The sge_job_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;mtrr_device_t,unla-
beled_t,proc_type,sge_job_exec_t,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type,shell_exec_t&quot; file types. The
default entrypoint paths for the sge_job_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system, /bin/d?ash,
/bin/zsh.*, /bin/ksh.*, /bin/yash, /bin/mksh, /bin/sash,
/bin/tcsh, /bin/bash, /bin/fish, /bin/bash2, /usr/bin/fish,
/sbin/nologin, /usr/sbin/sesh, /usr/sbin/smrsh,
/usr/bin/scponly, /usr/libexec/sesh, /usr/sbin/scpon- lyc,
/usr/bin/git-shell, /usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sge_job policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sge_job processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for sge_job:</p>

<p>sge_job_ssh_t, sge_job_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a sge_job_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type sge_job_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sge_job policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their sge_job processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sge_job:</p>

<p>sge_job_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sge_job_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the sge_job_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type sge_job_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
