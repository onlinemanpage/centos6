<p>svc_selinux(8) svc SELinux Policy documentation
svc_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME svc_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the svc processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux svc policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their svc processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for svc:</p>

<p>svc_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as svc configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/dnscache/env(/.*)?, /var/tinydns/env(/.*)?,
/var/axfrdns/env(/.*)?, /var/service/.*/env(/.*)?</p>

<p>svc_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as svc log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>svc_multilog_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_multilog_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the svc_multilog_t
domain.</p>

<p>svc_run_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_run_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the svc_run_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/tinydns/run, /var/qmail/supervise/.*/run,
/usr/bin/fghack, /var/axfrdns/log/run, /var/tinydns/log/run,
/var/ser- vice/.*/log/run, /var/axfrdns/run,
/usr/bin/setuidgid, /var/qmail/supervise/.*/log/run,
/usr/bin/envuidgid, /usr/bin/envdir, /var/dnscache/run,
/usr/bin/softlimit, /var/ser- vice/.*/run.*,
/usr/bin/pgrphack, /var/dnscache/log/run,
/usr/bin/setlock</p>

<p>svc_start_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_start_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the svc_start_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/svok, /usr/bin/svscan, /usr/bin/svc,
/usr/bin/svscanboot, /usr/bin/supervise</p>

<p>svc_svc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the svc_svc_t type, if you want to
treat the files as svc svc data.</p>

<p>Paths: /service, /var/tinydns(/.*)?,
/var/qmail/supervise(/.*)?, /ser- vice/.*, /var/service/.*,
/var/dnscache(/.*)?, /var/axfrdns(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux svc policy is very flexible allowing users to
setup their svc processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for svc:</p>

<p>svc_multilog_t, svc_start_t, svc_run_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
