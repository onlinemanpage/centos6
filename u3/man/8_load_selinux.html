<p>load_selinux(8) load SELinux Policy documentation
load_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME load_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the load processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. load policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run load with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to boolean to determine whether the system
permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing
boolean values. Set this to true and you have to reboot to
set it bac, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1</p>

<p>If you want to allows xdm to execute bootloade, you must
turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load
module, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux load policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their load processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for load:</p>

<p>load_policy_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the load_policy_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the load_policy_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/load_policy, /sbin/load_policy</p>

<p>loadkeys_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the loadkeys_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the loadkeys_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /bin/unikeys, /bin/loadkeys</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux load policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their load pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for load:</p>

<p>loadkeys_t, load_policy_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
