<p>ledctl(8) Intel(R) Enclosure LED Control Application
ledctl(8)</p>

<p>NAME ledctl - Intel(R) LED control application for a
storage enclosures.</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS ledctl [OPTIONS] pattern_name=list_of_devices
...</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION The ledctl is user space application design
to control LEDs associated with each slot in an enclosure or
a drive bay. There are two types of system: 2-LEDs system
(Activity LED, Status LED) and 3-LEDs system (Activity LED,
Locate LED, Fail LED). User must have root privileges to use
this application.</p>

<p>The ledctl application uses SGPIO and SES-2 protocol to
control LEDs. The program implements IBPI patterns of
SFF-8489 specification for SGPIO. Please note some
enclosures do not stick close to SFF-8489 specification. It
might happen that enclosure processor will accept an IBPI
pattern but it will blink the LEDs not according to SFF-8489
specification or it has limited number of patterns
supported.</p>

<p>LED management (AHCI) and SAF-TE protocols are not
supported.</p>

<p>The ledctl application has been verified to work with
Intel(R) storage controllers (i.e. Intel(R) AHCI
controller). The application might work with storage
controllers of other vendors (especially SCSI/SAS
controllers). However storage controllers of other vendors
have not been tested.</p>

<p>The ledmon application has the highest priority when
accessing LEDs then other programs. It means some patterns
set by ledctl may have no effect (except Locate
pattern).</p>

<p>The ledctl application is part of Intel(R) Enclosure LED
Utilities.</p>

<p>Pattern Names The ledctl application accepts the
following names for pattern_name argument according to
SFF-8489 specification.</p>

<p>locate Turns Locate LED associated with the given
device(s) or empty slot(s) on.</p>

<p>locate_off Only turns Locate LED off.</p>

<p>normal Turns Status LED, Failure LED and Locate LED
off.</p>

<p>off Only turns Status LED and Failure LED off.</p>

<p>ica or degraded Visualizes &quot;In a Critical
Array&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>rebuild or rebuild_p Visualizes &quot;Rebuild&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>ifa or failed_array Visualizes &quot;In a Failed
Array&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>hotspare Visualizes &quot;Hotspare&quot; pattern.</p>

<p>pfa Visualizes &quot;Predicted Failure Analysis&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>failure or disk_failed Visualizes &quot;Failure&quot;
pattern.</p>

<p>List of Devices The application accepts a list of
devices in two formats. The first format is a list with
comma separated elements. The second format is a list in
curly braces and elements are separated by space. See
examples section bellow for details.</p>

<p>A device is a path to file in /dev directory or in
/sys/block directory. It may identify a block device, a RAID
device or a container device. In case of RAID device or
container device a state will be set for all block devices
associated, respectively.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -c or --config=path Sets a path to local
configuration file. If this option is specified the global
configuration file and user configuration file has no
effect.</p>

<p>-l or --log=path Sets a path to local log file. If this
option is specified the global log file /var/log/ledctl.log
is not used.</p>

<p>--quiet Turns off all messages send to
&quot;stdout&quot; or &quot;stderr&quot; out. The messages
will be still logged to local file and syslog facility.</p>

<p>-h or --help Prints this text out and exits.</p>

<p>-v or --version Displays version of ledctl and
information about the license and exits.</p>

<p>FILES /var/log/ledctl.log Global log file, used by all
instances of ledctl application. To force logging to user
defined file use -l option switch.</p>

<p>~/.ledctl User configuration file, shared between ledmon
and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>/etc/ledcfg.conf Global configuration file, shared
between ledmon and all ledctl application instances.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES The following example illustrates how to locate
a single block device.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/sda</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to off Locate LED
for the same block device.</p>

<p>ledctl locate_off=/dev/sda</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to locate disks of
a RAID device and how to set rebuild pattern for two block
devices at the same time. This example uses both formats of
device list.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/md127 rebuild={ /sys/block/sd[a-b]
}</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to off Status LED
and Failure LED for the given device(s).</p>

<p>ledctl off={ /dev/sda /dev/sdb }</p>

<p>The following example illustrates how to locate a three
block devices. This example uses first format of device
list.</p>

<p>ledctl locate=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb,/dev/sdc</p>
