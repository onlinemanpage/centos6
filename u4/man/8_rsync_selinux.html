<p>rsync_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for rsync
rsync_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME rsync_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the rsync processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rsync
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The rsync processes execute with the rsync_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep rsync_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The rsync_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;rsync_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the rsync_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/rsync</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux rsync policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their rsync pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for rsync:</p>

<p>rsync_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a rsync_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type rsync_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. rsync policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run rsync with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow postgresql to use ssh and rsync for
point-in-time recovery, you must turn on the
postgresql_can_rsync boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P postgresql_can_rsync 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to export any
files/directories read only, you must turn on the
rsync_export_all_ro boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_export_all_ro 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync servers to share nfs files
systems, you must turn on the rsync_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync servers to share cifs files
systems, you must turn on the rsync_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to run as a client, you must
turn on the rsync_client boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_client 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow postgresql to use ssh and rsync for
point-in-time recovery, you must turn on the
postgresql_can_rsync boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P postgresql_can_rsync 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to modify public files used
for public file transfer services. Files/Directories must be
labeled public_con- tent_rw_t, you must turn on the
allow_rsync_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_rsync_anon_write 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to export any
files/directories read only, you must turn on the
rsync_export_all_ro boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_export_all_ro 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync servers to share nfs files
systems, you must turn on the rsync_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync servers to share cifs files
systems, you must turn on the rsync_use_cifs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_use_cifs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to run as a client, you must
turn on the rsync_client boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_client 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow rsync servers to read the /var/rsync directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/rsync(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/rsync</p>

<p>Allow rsync servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming
by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and
by restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_rsyncd_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/rsync/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/rsync/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync to modify public files used
for public file transfer services. Files/Directories must be
labeled public_con- tent_rw_t., you must turn on the
allow_rsync_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_rsync_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux rsync policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rsync processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for rsync:</p>

<p>rsync_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_data_t type, if you want to
treat the files as rsync content.</p>

<p>rsync_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_etc_t type, if you want to
store rsync files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>rsync_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the rsync_t domain.</p>

<p>rsync_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as rsync log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>rsync_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_tmp_t type, if you want to
store rsync tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>rsync_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the rsync_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the rsync files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux rsync policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their rsync processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for rsync:</p>

<p>rsync_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 873 udp 873</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type rsync_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>rsync_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/rsync.log.*</p>

<p>rsync_tmp_t</p>

<p>rsync_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/rsyncd.lock</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
