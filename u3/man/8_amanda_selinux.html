<p>amanda_selinux(8) amanda SELinux Policy documentation
amanda_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME amanda_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the amanda pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures amanda (Automated
backup program) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux amanda policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their amanda processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for amanda:</p>

<p>amanda_amandates_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_amandates_t type, if you
want to treat the files as amanda amandates data.</p>

<p>amanda_config_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_config_t type, if you want
to treat the files as amanda configuration data, usually
stored under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/amanda(/.*)?,
/var/lib/amanda/.amandahosts</p>

<p>amanda_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_data_t type, if you want to
treat the files as amanda content.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/amanda/[^/]+(/.*)?,
/etc/amanda/.*/tapelist(/.*)?,
/etc/amanda/.*/index(/.*)?</p>

<p>amanda_dumpdates_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_dumpdates_t type, if you
want to treat the files as amanda dumpdates data.</p>

<p>amanda_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the amanda_t domain.</p>

<p>amanda_gnutarlists_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_gnutarlists_t type, if you
want to treat the files as amanda gnutarlists data.</p>

<p>amanda_inetd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_inetd_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the amanda_inetd_t
domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/lib(64)?/amanda/amidxtaped,
/usr/lib(64)?/amanda/amandad,
/usr/lib(64)?/amanda/amindexd</p>

<p>amanda_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as amanda log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/amanda(/.*)?,
/var/lib/amanda/[^/]*/log(/.*)?</p>

<p>amanda_recover_dir_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_recover_dir_t type, if you
want to treat the files as amanda recover dir data.</p>

<p>amanda_recover_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_recover_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the amanda_recover_t
domain.</p>

<p>amanda_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_tmp_t type, if you want to
store amanda temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>amanda_usr_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_usr_lib_t type, if you want
to treat the files as amanda usr lib data.</p>

<p>amanda_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the amanda_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the amanda files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/amanda,
/var/lib/amanda/[^/]+/index(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux amanda policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their amanda processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for amanda:</p>

<p>amanda_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux amanda policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their amanda processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for amanda:</p>

<p>amanda_t, amanda_recover_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
