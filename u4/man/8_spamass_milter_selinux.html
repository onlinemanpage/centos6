<p>NAME spamass_milter_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the spa- mass_milter processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
spamass_milter processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The spamass_milter processes execute with the
spamass_milter_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by executing the ps command with the
-Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep spamass_milter_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The spamass_milter_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;spamass_mil- ter_exec_t&quot; file
type. The default entrypoint paths for the spa-
mass_milter_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/spamass-milter</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux spamass_milter policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their spamass_milter processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
spamass_milter:</p>

<p>spamass_milter_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a spamass_milter_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type spamass_milter_t
permissive. Per- missive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux spamass_milter policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their spamass_milter processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
spamass_milter:</p>

<p>spamass_milter_data_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamass_milter_data_t type, if you
want to treat the files as spamass milter content.</p>

<p>spamass_milter_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamass_milter_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the spamass_milter_t
domain.</p>

<p>spamass_milter_state_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the spamass_milter_state_t type, if you
want to treat the files as spamass milter state data.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type spamass_milter_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>spamass_milter_data_t</p>

<p>/var/run/spamass-milter(/.*)?
/var/run/spamass-milter.pid</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
