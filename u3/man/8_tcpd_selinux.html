<p>tcpd_selinux(8) tcpd SELinux Policy documentation
tcpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME tcpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the tcpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures tcpd (Policy for TCP
daemon) processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. tcpd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run tcpd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow the Telepathy connection managers
to connect to any generic TCP port, you must turn on the
telepathy_tcp_con- nect_generic_network_ports boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P telepathy_tcp_connect_generic_network_ports
1</p>

<p>If you want to allow all daemons to use tcp wrappers,
you must turn on the allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow users to run TCP servers (bind to
ports and accept connection from the same domain and outside
users) disabling this forces FTP passive mode and may change
other protocols, you must turn on the user_tcp_server
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P user_tcp_server 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux tcpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their tcpd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for tcpd:</p>

<p>tcpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tcpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the tcpd_t domain.</p>

<p>tcpd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tcpd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store tcpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux tcpd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their tcpd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for tcpd:</p>

<p>tcpd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
