<p>NAME ocf_heartbeat_sfex - Manages exclusive access to
shared storage using Shared Disk File EXclusiveness
(SF-EX)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sfex [start | stop | monitor | meta-data |
validate-all]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Resource script for SF-EX. It manages a
shared storage medium exclusively .</p>

<p>SUPPORTED PARAMETERS device Block device path that
stores exclusive control data. (required, string, no
default)</p>

<p>index Location in block device where exclusive control
data is stored. 1 or more is specified. Default is 1.
(optional, integer, default 1)</p>

<p>collision_timeout Waiting time when a collision of lock
acquisition is detected. Default is 1 second. (optional,
integer, default 1)</p>

<p>monitor_interval Monitor interval(sec). Default is 10
seconds (optional, integer, default 10)</p>

<p>lock_timeout Valid term of lock(sec). Default is 100
seconds. The lock_timeout is calculated by the following
formula. .sp lock_timeout = monitor_interval + &quot;The
expiration time of the lock&quot; .sp We suggest 90 seconds
as a default value of the &quot;The expiration time of the
lock&quot;, but you should change it in consideration of
access delay to the shared disk and the switch time of the
multipath driver. .sp The lock timeout have an impact on
start action timeout because start action timeout value is
calculated by the following formula. .sp start timeout =
collision_timeout + lock_timeout + &quot;safety margin&quot;
.sp The &quot;safety margin&quot; is decided within the
range of about 10-20 seconds(It depends on your system
requirement). (optional, integer, default 100)</p>

<p>SUPPORTED ACTIONS This resource agent supports the
following actions (operations):</p>

<p>start Starts the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
120s.</p>

<p>stop Stops the resource. Suggested minimum timeout:
20s.</p>

<p>monitor Performs a detailed status check. Suggested
minimum timeout: 10s. Suggested interval: 10s.</p>

<p>meta-data Retrieves resource agent metadata (internal
use only). Suggested minimum timeout: 5s.</p>

<p>validate-all Performs a validation of the resource
configuration. Suggested minimum timeout: 5s.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following is an example configuration for a
sfex resource using the crm(8) shell:</p>

<p>primitive p_sfex ocf:heartbeat:sfex params device=string
op monitor depth=&quot;0&quot; timeout=&quot;10s&quot;
interval=&quot;10s&quot;</p>
