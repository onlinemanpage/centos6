<p>NAME pmdarpm - RPM packages performance metrics domain
agent (PMDA)</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm/pmdarpm [-C] [-d domain] [-l
logfile] [-r path] [-U username]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION pmdarpm is a Performance Metrics Domain
Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics reflecting
the state of the RPM package database managed by rpm(1).</p>

<p>The rpm PMDA exports metrics that describe each package
installed on a system, as well as some cumulative totals.
When the RPM database changes the PMDA automatically detects
this and uses a background thread to asynchronously refresh
its values.</p>

<p>A brief description of the pmdarpm command line options
follows:</p>

<p>-C Verify the package iteration code by scanning the RPM
database once, then exiting. Only useful for problem
diagnosis and test- ing.</p>

<p>-d It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics
domain num- ber specified here is unique and consistent.
That is, domain should be different for every PMDA on the
one host, and the same domain number should be used for the
same PMDA on all hosts.</p>

<p>-l Location of the log file. By default, a log file
named rpm.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
when pmdarpm is started, i.e. $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd. If the log
file cannot be cre- ated or is not writable, output is
written to the standard error instead.</p>

<p>-r Specify an alternate path to the RPM database
(default is /var/lib/rpm/Packages).</p>

<p>-U User account under which to run the agent. The
default is the unprivileged &quot;pcp&quot; account.</p>

<p>INSTALLATION If you want access to the names, help text
and values for the rpm per- formance metrics, do the
following as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm # ./Install</p>

<p>If you want to undo the installation, do the following
as root:</p>

<p># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm # ./Remove</p>

<p>pmdarpm is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify
pmcd(1) when the agent is installed or removed.</p>

<p>FILES $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH command line options used to
launch pmdarpm $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm/help default help text
file for the rpm metrics $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm/Install
installation script for the pmdarpm agent
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rpm/Remove undo installation script for the
pmdarpm agent $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/rpm.log default log file for
error messages and other information from pmdarpm</p>

<p>PCP ENVIRONMENT Environment variables with the prefix
PCP_ are used to parameterize the file and directory names
used by PCP. On each installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf
contains the local values for these variables. The $PCP_CONF
variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration
file, as described in pcp.conf(5).</p>
