<p>syslogd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for
syslogd syslogd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME syslogd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the syslogd pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the syslogd
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The syslogd processes execute with the syslogd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep syslogd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The syslogd_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;syslogd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the syslogd_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/sbin/syslogd, /sbin/minilogd, /sbin/rsyslogd,
/sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/sbin/metalog, /usr/sbin/syslogd,
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd, /usr/sbin/syslog-ng</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for syslogd:</p>

<p>syslogd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a syslogd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type syslogd_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. syslogd policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run syslogd with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you
must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you
must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for syslogd:</p>

<p>syslogd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the syslogd_t domain.</p>

<p>syslogd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the syslogd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>syslogd_keytab_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_keytab_t type, if you want
to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.</p>

<p>syslogd_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_tmp_t type, if you want to
store syslogd temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>syslogd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the syslogd files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>syslogd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the syslogd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the syslogd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for syslogd:</p>

<p>syslogd_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 6514 udp 514,6514</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type syslogd_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>krb5_host_rcache_t</p>

<p>/var/cache/krb5rcache(/.*)? /var/tmp/host_0
/var/tmp/HTTP_23</p>

<p>logfile</p>

<p>all log files</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>security_t</p>

<p>syslogd_tmp_t</p>

<p>syslogd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/rsyslog(/.*)? /var/lib/syslog-ng(/.*)?
/var/lib/syslog-ng.persist</p>

<p>syslogd_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/syslog-ng.ctl /var/run/syslog-ng(/.*)?
/var/log/syslog-ng(/.*)? /var/run/metalog.pid
/var/run/syslogd.pid</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
