<p>gitosis_selinux(8) gitosis SELinux Policy documentation
gitosis_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME gitosis_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the gitosis pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures gitosis (Tools for
managing and hosting git repositories) processes via
flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. gitosis policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run gitosis with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow cgit to access gitosis files, you
must turn on the git_cgit_read_gitosis_content boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P git_cgit_read_gitosis_content 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux gitosis policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their gitosis processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for gitosis:</p>

<p>gitosis_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gitosis_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the gitosis_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/bin/gitosis-serve,
/usr/bin/gl-auth-command</p>

<p>gitosis_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the gitosis_var_lib_t type, if you want
to store the gitosis files under the /var/lib directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/lib/gitolite(/.*)?,
/var/lib/gitosis(/.*)?</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux gitosis policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their gitosis processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for gitosis:</p>

<p>gitosis_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
