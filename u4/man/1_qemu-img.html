<p>NAME qemu-img - QEMU disk image utility</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS usage: qemu-img command [command options]</p>

<p>OPTIONS The following commands are supported:</p>

<p>check [-f fmt] filename create [-f fmt] [-o options]
filename [size] commit [-f fmt] [-t cache] filename convert
[-c] [-p] [-f fmt] [-t cache] [-O output_fmt] [-o options]
[-S sparse_size] filename [filename2 [...]] output_filename
info [-f fmt] filename snapshot [-l | -a snapshot | -c
snapshot | -d snapshot] filename rebase [-f fmt] [-t cache]
[-p] [-u] -b backing_file [-F backing_fmt] filename resize
filename [+ | -]size</p>

<p>Command parameters:</p>

<p>filename is a disk image filename</p>

<p>fmt is the disk image format. It is guessed
automatically in most cases. See below for a description of
the supported disk formats.</p>

<p>size is the disk image size in bytes. Optional suffixes
&quot;k&quot; or &quot;K&quot; (kilobyte, 1024)
&quot;M&quot; (megabyte, 1024k) and &quot;G&quot; (gigabyte,
1024M) and T (terabyte, 1024G) are supported. &quot;b&quot;
is ignored.</p>

<p>output_filename is the destination disk image
filename</p>

<p>output_fmt is the destination format</p>

<p>options is a comma separated list of format specific
options in a name=value format. Use &quot;-o ?&quot; for an
overview of the options supported by the used format or see
the format descriptions below for details.</p>

<p>-c indicates that target image must be compressed (qcow
format only)</p>

<p>-h with or without a command shows help and lists the
supported formats</p>

<p>-p display progress bar (convert and rebase commands
only)</p>

<p>-S size indicates the consecutive number of bytes that
must contain only zeros for qemu-img to create a sparse
image during conversion. This value is rounded down to the
nearest 512 bytes. You may use the common size suffixes like
&quot;k&quot; for kilobytes.</p>

<p>-t cache specifies the cache mode that should be used
with the (destination) file. See the documentation of the
emulator s &quot;-drive cache=...&quot; option for allowed
values.</p>

<p>Parameters to snapshot subcommand:</p>

<p>snapshot is the name of the snapshot to create, apply or
delete</p>

<p>-a applies a snapshot (revert disk to saved state)</p>

<p>-c creates a snapshot</p>

<p>-d deletes a snapshot</p>

<p>-l lists all snapshots in the given image</p>

<p>Command description:</p>

<p>check [-f fmt] filename Perform a consistency check on
the disk image filename.</p>

<p>Only the formats &quot;qcow2&quot;, &quot;qed&quot; and
&quot;vdi&quot; support consistency checks.</p>

<p>create [-f fmt] [-o options] filename [size] Create the
new disk image filename of size size and format fmt.
Depending on the file format, you can add one or more
options that enable additional features of this format.</p>

<p>If the option backing_file is specified, then the image
will record only the differences from backing_file. No size
needs to be specified in this case. backing_file will never
be modified unless you use the &quot;commit&quot; monitor
command (or qemu-img commit).</p>

<p>The size can also be specified using the size option
with &quot;-o&quot;, it doesnt need to be specified
separately in this case.</p>

<p>commit [-f fmt] [-t cache] filename Commit the changes
recorded in filename in its base image.</p>

<p>convert [-c] [-p] [-f fmt] [-t cache] [-O output_fmt]
[-o options] [-S sparse_size] filename [filename2 [...]]
output_filename Convert the disk image filename to disk
image output_filename using format output_fmt. It can be
optionally compressed (&quot;-c&quot; option) or use any
format specific options like encryption (&quot;-o&quot;
option).</p>

<p>Only the formats &quot;qcow&quot; and &quot;qcow2&quot;
support compression. The compression is read-only. It means
that if a compressed sector is rewritten, then it is
rewritten as uncompressed data.</p>

<p>Image conversion is also useful to get smaller image
when using a growable format such as &quot;qcow&quot; or
&quot;cow&quot;: the empty sectors are detected and
suppressed from the destination image.</p>

<p>You can use the backing_file option to force the output
image to be created as a copy on write image of the
specified base image; the backing_file should have the same
content as the input s base image, however the path, image
format, etc may differ.</p>

<p>info [-f fmt] filename Give information about the disk
image filename. Use it in particular to know the size
reserved on disk which can be different from the displayed
size. If VM snapshots are stored in the disk image, they are
displayed too.</p>

<p>snapshot [-l | -a snapshot | -c snapshot | -d snapshot ]
filename List, apply, create or delete snapshots in image
filename.</p>

<p>rebase [-f fmt] [-t cache] [-p] [-u] -b backing_file [-F
backing_fmt] filename Changes the backing file of an image.
Only the formats &quot;qcow2&quot; and &quot;qed&quot;
support changing the backing file.</p>

<p>The backing file is changed to backing_file and (if the
image format of filename supports this) the backing file
format is changed to backing_fmt.</p>

<p>There are two different modes in which
&quot;rebase&quot; can operate:</p>

<p>Safe mode This is the default mode and performs a real
rebase operation. The new backing file may differ from the
old one and qemu-img rebase will take care of keeping the
guest-visible content of filename unchanged.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, any clusters that differ
between backing_file and the old backing file of filename
are merged into filename before actually changing the
backing file.</p>

<p>Note that the safe mode is an expensive operation,
comparable to converting an image. It only works if the old
backing file still exists.</p>

<p>Unsafe mode qemu-img uses the unsafe mode if
&quot;-u&quot; is specified. In this mode, only the backing
file name and format of filename is changed without any
checks on the file contents. The user must take care of
specifying the correct new backing file, or the
guest-visible content of the image will be corrupted.</p>

<p>This mode is useful for renaming or moving the backing
file to somewhere else. It can be used without an accessible
old backing file, i.e. you can use it to fix an image whose
backing file has already been moved/renamed.</p>

<p>resize filename [+ | -]size Change the disk image as if
it had been created with size.</p>

<p>Before using this command to shrink a disk image, you
MUST use file system and partitioning tools inside the VM to
reduce allocated file systems and partition sizes
accordingly. Failure to do so will result in data loss!</p>

<p>After using this command to grow a disk image, you must
use file system and partitioning tools inside the VM to
actually begin using the new space on the device.</p>

<p>Supported image file formats:</p>

<p>raw Raw disk image format (default). This format has the
advantage of being simple and easily exportable to all other
emulators. If your file system supports holes (for example
in ext2 or ext3 on Linux or NTFS on Windows), then only the
written sectors will reserve space. Use &quot;qemu-img
info&quot; to know the real size used by the image or
&quot;ls -ls&quot; on Unix/Linux.</p>

<p>host_device Host device format. This format should be
used instead of raw when converting to block devices or
other devices where &quot;holes&quot; are not supported.</p>

<p>qcow2 QEMU image format, the most versatile format. Use
it to have smaller images (useful if your filesystem does
not supports holes, for example on Windows), optional AES
encryption, zlib based compression and support of multiple
VM snapshots.</p>

<p>Supported options:</p>

<p>&quot;backing_file&quot; File name of a base image (see
create subcommand)</p>

<p>&quot;backing_fmt&quot; Image format of the base
image</p>

<p>&quot;encryption&quot; If this option is set to
&quot;on&quot;, the image is encrypted.</p>

<p>Encryption uses the AES format which is very secure (128
bit keys). Use a long password (16 characters) to get
maximum protection.</p>

<p>&quot;cluster_size&quot; Changes the qcow2 cluster size
(must be between 512 and 2M). Smaller cluster sizes can
improve the image file size whereas larger cluster sizes
generally provide better performance.</p>

<p>&quot;preallocation&quot; Preallocation mode (allowed
values: off, metadata, full). An image with preallocated
metadata is initially larger but can improve performance
when the image needs to grow. Full preallocation
additionally writes zeros to the whole image in order to
preallocate lower layers (e.g. the file system containing
the image file) as well. Note that full preallocation writes
to every byte of the virtual disk, so it can take a long
time for large images.</p>

<p>qcow Old QEMU image format. Left for compatibility.</p>

<p>Supported options:</p>

<p>&quot;backing_file&quot; File name of a base image (see
create subcommand)</p>

<p>&quot;encryption&quot; If this option is set to
&quot;on&quot;, the image is encrypted.</p>

<p>cow User Mode Linux Copy On Write image format. Used to
be the only growable image format in QEMU. It is supported
only for compatibility with previous versions. It does not
work on win32.</p>

<p>vdi VirtualBox 1.1 compatible image format.</p>

<p>vmdk VMware 3 and 4 compatible image format.</p>

<p>Supported options:</p>

<p>&quot;backing_fmt&quot; Image format of the base
image</p>

<p>&quot;compat6&quot; Create a VMDK version 6 image
(instead of version 4)</p>

<p>vpc VirtualPC compatible image format (VHD).</p>

<p>cloop Linux Compressed Loop image, useful only to reuse
directly compressed CD-ROM images present for example in the
Knoppix CD- ROMs.</p>
