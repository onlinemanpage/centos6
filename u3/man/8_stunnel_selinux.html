<p>stunnel_selinux(8) stunnel SELinux Policy documentation
stunnel_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME stunnel_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the stunnel pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures stunnel (SSL Tunneling
Proxy) processes via flex- ible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_etc_t type, if you want to
store stunnel files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>stunnel_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the stunnel_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/stunnel, /usr/bin/stunnel</p>

<p>stunnel_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_tmp_t type, if you want to
store stunnel temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>stunnel_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the stunnel_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the stunnel files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 8021</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux stunnel policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their stunnel processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for stunnel:</p>

<p>stunnel_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
