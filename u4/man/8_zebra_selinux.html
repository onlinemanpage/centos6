<p>zebra_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for zebra
zebra_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME zebra_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the zebra processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zebra
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The zebra processes execute with the zebra_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep zebra_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The zebra_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;zebra_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the zebra_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/rip.*, /usr/sbin/ospf.*, /usr/sbin/bgpd,
/usr/sbin/zebra</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their zebra pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for zebra:</p>

<p>zebra_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a zebra_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type zebra_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. zebra policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run zebra with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow zebra daemon to write it
configuration files, you must turn on the
allow_zebra_write_config boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_zebra_write_config 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow zebra daemon to write it
configuration files, you must turn on the
allow_zebra_write_config boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_zebra_write_config 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their zebra processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for zebra:</p>

<p>zebra_conf_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_conf_t type, if you want to
treat the files as zebra configuration data, usually stored
under the /etc directory.</p>

<p>zebra_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the zebra_t domain.</p>

<p>zebra_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the zebra_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>zebra_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as zebra log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>zebra_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_tmp_t type, if you want to
store zebra tem- porary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>zebra_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the zebra_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the zebra files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their zebra processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for zebra:</p>

<p>zebra_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: tcp 2600-2604,2606 udp
2600-2604,2606</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type zebra_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>zebra_conf_t</p>

<p>/etc/zebra(/.*)? /etc/quagga(/.*)?</p>

<p>zebra_log_t</p>

<p>/var/log/zebra(/.*)? /var/log/quagga(/.*)?</p>

<p>zebra_var_run_t</p>

<p>/var/run/quagga(/.*)? /var/run/.zebra
/var/run/.zserv</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
