<p>sanlock_selinux(8) sanlock SELinux Policy documentation
sanlock_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME sanlock_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the sanlock pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures sanlock (policy for
sanlock) processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. sanlock policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run sanlock with the tightest access possi- ble.</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact
with the san- loc, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage
nfs file, you must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage
cifs file, you must turn on the sanlock_use_samba
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure
a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for sanlock:</p>

<p>sanlock_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the sanlock_t domain.</p>

<p>sanlock_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the sanlock_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>sanlock_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as sanlock log data, usually stored under the
/var/log directory.</p>

<p>sanlock_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the sanlock_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the sanlock files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for sanlock:</p>

<p>sanlock_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
