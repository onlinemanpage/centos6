<p>NAME sssd-simple - the configuration file for
SSSD&acute;s &acute;simple&acute; access-control
provider</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the configuration
of the simple access-control provider for sssd(8). For a
detailed syntax reference, refer to the FILE FORMAT section
of the sssd.conf(5) manual page.</p>

<p>The simple access provider grants or denies access based
on an access or deny list of user or group names. The
following rules apply:</p>

<p>&middot; If all lists are empty, access is granted</p>

<p>&middot; If any list is provided, the order of
evaluation is allow,deny. This means that any matching deny
rule will supersede any matched allow rule.</p>

<p>&middot; If either or both &quot;allow&quot; lists are
provided, all users are denied unless they appear in the
list.</p>

<p>&middot; If only &quot;deny&quot; lists are provided,
all users are granted access unless they appear in the
list.</p>

<p>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS Refer to the section DOMAIN
SECTIONS of the sssd.conf(5) manual page for details on the
configuration of an SSSD domain.</p>

<p>simple_allow_users (string) Comma separated list of
users who are allowed to log in.</p>

<p>simple_deny_users (string) Comma separated list of users
who are explicitly denied access.</p>

<p>simple_allow_groups (string) Comma separated list of
groups that are allowed to log in. This applies only to
groups within this SSSD domain. Local groups are not
evaluated.</p>

<p>simple_deny_groups (string) Comma separated list of
groups that are explicitly denied access. This applies only
to groups within this SSSD domain. Local groups are not
evaluated.</p>

<p>Please note that it is an configuration error if both,
simple_allow_users and simple_deny_users, are defined.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE The following example assumes that SSSD is
correctly configured and example.com is one of the domains
in the [sssd] section. This examples shows only the simple
access provider-specific options.</p>

<p>[domain/example.com] access_provider = simple
simple_allow_users = user1, user2</p>
