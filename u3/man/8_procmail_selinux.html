<p>procmail_selinux(8) procmail SELinux Policy
documentation procmail_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME procmail_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the procmail pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures procmail (Procmail
mail delivery agent) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux procmail policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their procmail processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for procmail:</p>

<p>procmail_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the procmail_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the procmail_t domain.</p>

<p>procmail_home_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the procmail_home_t type, if you want
to store proc- mail files in the users home directory.</p>

<p>procmail_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the procmail_log_t type, if you want to
treat the data as procmail log data, usually stored under
the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/log/procmail.log.*,
/var/log/procmail(/.*)?</p>

<p>procmail_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the procmail_tmp_t type, if you want to
store procmail temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux procmail policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their procmail processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
procmail:</p>

<p>procmail_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
