<p>iptables_selinux(8) iptables SELinux Policy
documentation iptables_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME iptables_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the iptables pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures iptables (Policy for
iptables) processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. ipta- bles policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run iptables with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow dhcpc client applications to
execute iptables com- mand, you must turn on the
dhcpc_exec_iptables boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P dhcpc_exec_iptables 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux iptables policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their iptables processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for iptables:</p>

<p>iptables_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the iptables_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the iptables_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /sbin/ebtables-restore, /usr/sbin/ipchains.*,
/usr/sbin/iptables- restore, /sbin/ipvsadm-save,
/sbin/ipchains.*, /sbin/ip6?tables, /usr/sbin/iptables,
/sbin/ipvsadm, /usr/sbin/iptables-multi,
/sbin/ipvsadm-restore, /sbin/ebtables,
/sbin/ip6?tables-multi, /sbin/ip6?tables-restore</p>

<p>iptables_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the iptables_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to tran- sition an executable to the iptables_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>iptables_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the iptables_tmp_t type, if you want to
store iptables temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>iptables_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the iptables_var_run_t type, if you
want to store the iptables files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux iptables policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their iptables processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
iptables:</p>

<p>iptables_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
