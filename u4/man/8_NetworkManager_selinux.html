<p>NetworkManager_sSELinux8Policy documentation for
NetwNetworkManager_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME NetworkManager_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the Net- workManager processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
NetworkManager processes via flexi- ble mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The NetworkManager processes execute with the
NetworkManager_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by executing the ps command with the
-Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep NetworkManager_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The NetworkManager_t SELinux type can be
entered via the &quot;NetworkMan- ager_exec_t&quot; file
type. The default entrypoint paths for the Network-
Manager_t domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/s?bin/NetworkManager, /usr/s?bin/wpa_supplicant,
/usr/sbin/wicd, /sbin/wpa_supplicant,
/usr/sbin/nm-system-settings, /usr/sbin/Network-
ManagerDispatcher</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux NetworkManager policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their NetworkManager processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
NetworkManager:</p>

<p>NetworkManager_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a NetworkManager_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type NetworkManager_t
permissive. Per- missive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux NetworkManager policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their NetworkManager processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
NetworkManager:</p>

<p>NetworkManager_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the NetworkManager_t
domain.</p>

<p>NetworkManager_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_initrc_exec_t type,
if you want to transition an executable to the
NetworkManager_initrc_t domain.</p>

<p>NetworkManager_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_log_t type, if you
want to treat the data as NetworkManager log data, usually
stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>NetworkManager_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_tmp_t type, if you
want to store NetworkManager temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>NetworkManager_var_lib_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_var_lib_t type, if
you want to store the NetworkManager files under the
/var/lib directory.</p>

<p>NetworkManager_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the NetworkManager_var_run_t type, if
you want to store the NetworkManager files under the /run
directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type NetworkManager_t
can manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC per-
missions.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
