<p>tftpd_selinux(8) SELinux Policy documentation for tftpd
tftpd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME tftpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the tftpd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tftpd
processes via flexible manda- tory access control.</p>

<p>The tftpd processes execute with the tftpd_t SELinux
type. You can check if you have these processes running by
executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep tftpd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The tftpd_t SELinux type can be entered via
the &quot;tftpd_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the tftpd_t domain are the fol-
lowing:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/sbin/atftpd, /usr/sbin/in.tftpd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux tftpd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their tftpd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for tftpd:</p>

<p>tftpd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a tftpd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type tftpd_t permissive.
Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux.
AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. tftpd policy is extremely flexible and has
several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and
run tftpd with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow tftp to modify public files used
for public file transfer services, you must turn on the
tftp_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P tftp_anon_write 1</p>

<p>SHARING FILES If you want to share files with multiple
domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file
context of public_content_t and public_con- tent_rw_t. These
context allow any of the above domains to read the content.
If you want a particular domain to write to the public_con-
tent_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.</p>

<p>Allow tftpd servers to read the /var/tftpd directory by
adding the pub- lic_content_t file type to the directory and
by restoring the file type.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t
&quot;/var/tftpd(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/tftpd</p>

<p>Allow tftpd servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming
by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and
by restoring the file type. This also requires the
allow_tftpdd_anon_write boolean to be set.</p>

<p>semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t
&quot;/var/tftpd/incoming(/.*)?&quot; restorecon -F -R -v
/var/tftpd/incoming</p>

<p>If you want to allow tftp to modify public files used
for public file transfer services., you must turn on the
tftp_anon_write boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P tftp_anon_write 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux tftpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their tftpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for tftpd:</p>

<p>tftpd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tftpd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the tftpd_t domain.</p>

<p>tftpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tftpd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the tftpd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>tftpdir_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tftpdir_rw_t type, if you want to
treat the files as tftpdir read/write content.</p>

<p>tftpdir_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the tftpdir_t type, if you want to
treat the files as tftpdir data.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PORT TYPES SELinux defines port types to represent TCP
and UDP ports.</p>

<p>You can see the types associated with a port by using
the following command:</p>

<p>semanage port -l</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these ports. SELinux tftpd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their tftpd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following port types are defined for tftpd:</p>

<p>tftp_port_t</p>

<p>Default Defined Ports: udp 69</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type tftpd_t can
manage files labeled with the fol- lowing file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tftpd_var_run_t</p>

<p>tftpdir_rw_t</p>

<p>/var/lib/tftpboot(/.*)?</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage port can also be used to manipulate the port
definitions</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
