<p>DESCRIPTION lvcreate creates a new logical volume in a
volume group ( see vgcre- ate(8), vgchange(8) ) by
allocating logical extents from the free phys- ical extent
pool of that volume group. If there are not enough free
physical extents then the volume group can be extended ( see
vgex- tend(8) ) with other physical volumes or by reducing
existing logical volumes of this volume group in size ( see
lvreduce(8) ). If you spec- ify one or more PhysicalVolumes,
allocation of physical extents will be restricted to these
volumes. The second form supports the creation of snapshot
logical volumes which keep the contents of the original
logical volume for backup purposes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options.</p>

<p>-a, --available {y|n|ey|en|ly|ln} Controls the
availability of the Logical Volumes for immediate use after
the command finishes running. By default, new Logical
Volumes are activated automatically (-ay). If it is possible
technically, -an will leave the new Logical Volume inactive.
But for example, snapshots can only be created in the active
state so -an cannot be used with --snapshot. Normally the
--zero n argument has to be supplied too because zeroing
(the default behaviour) also requires activation. If
clustered lock- ing is enabled, -aey will activate
exclusively on one node and -aly will activate only on the
local node.</p>

<p>-c, --chunksize ChunkSize Gives the size of chunk for
snapshot and thin pool logical vol- umes. For snapshots the
value must be power of 2 between 4KiB and 512KiB and the
default value is 4. For thin pools the value must be power
of 2 between 64KiB and 1048576KiB and the default value
starts with 64 and scales up to fit the pool metadata size
within 128MB, if the poolmetadata size is not specified.
Default unit is in kilobytes.</p>

<p>-C, --contiguous {y|n} Sets or resets the contiguous
allocation policy for logical vol- umes. Default is no
contiguous allocation based on a next free principle.</p>

<p>-i, --stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes. This
is equal to the number of physical volumes to scatter the
logical volume.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. StripeSize
must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9) for metadata in LVM1 format. For
metadata in LVM2 format, the stripe size may be a larger
power of 2 but must not exceed the physical extent size.</p>

<p>-l, --extents
LogicalExtentsNumber[%{VG|PVS|FREE|ORIGIN}] Gives the number
of logical extents to allocate for the new log- ical volume.
The number can also be expressed as a percentage of the
total space in the Volume Group with the suffix %VG, as a
percentage of the remaining free space in the Volume Group
with the suffix %FREE, as a percentage of the remaining free
space for the specified PhysicalVolume(s) with the suffix
%PVS, or (for a snapshot) as a percentage of the total space
in the Ori- gin Logical Volume with the suffix %ORIGIN.</p>

<p>-L, --size LogicalVolumeSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Gives the
size to allocate for the new logical volume. A size suffix
of K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes, T for
terabytes, P for petabytes or E for exabytes is optional.
Default unit is megabytes.</p>

<p>--minor minor Set the minor number.</p>

<p>-M, --persistent {y|n} Set to y to make the minor number
specified persistent.</p>

<p>-m, --mirrors Mirrors Creates a mirrored logical volume
with Mirrors copies. For example, specifying &quot;-m
1&quot; would result in a mirror with two- sides; that is, a
linear volume plus one copy.</p>

<p>Specifying the optional argument --nosync will cause the
cre- ation of the mirror to skip the initial
resynchronization. Any data written afterwards will be
mirrored, but the original con- tents will not be copied.
This is useful for skipping a poten- tially long and
resource intensive initial sync of an empty device.</p>

<p>The optional argument --mirrorlog specifies the type of
log to be used. The default is disk, which is persistent and
requires a small amount of storage space, usually on a
separate device from the data being mirrored. Using core
means the mirror is regenerated by copying the data from the
first device again each time the device is activated, for
example, after every reboot. Using &quot;mirrored&quot; will
create a persistent log that is itself mirrored.</p>

<p>The optional argument --corelog is equivalent to
--mirrorlog core.</p>

<p>-n, --name LogicalVolume{Name|Path} The name for the new
logical volume. Without this option a default names of
&quot;lvol#&quot; will be generated where # is the LVM
internal number of the logical volume.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--monitor {y|n} Start or avoid monitoring a mirrored or
snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.
If a device used by a moni- tored mirror reports an I/O
error, the failure is handled according to
mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_pol- icy set
in lvm.conf.</p>

<p>--ignoremonitoring Make no attempt to interact with
dmeventd unless --monitor is specified.</p>

<p>-p, --permission {r|rw} Set access permissions to read
only or read and write. Default is read and write.</p>

<p>--poolmetadatasize MetadataSize[bBsSkKmMgG] Set the size
of thin pool s metadata logical volume. Supported value is
in range between 2MiB and 16GiB. Default value is
(Pool_LV_size / Pool_LV_chunk_size * 64b). Default unit is
megabytes.</p>

<p>-r, --readahead {ReadAheadSectors|auto|none} Set read
ahead sector count of this logical volume. For volume groups
with metadata in lvm1 format, this must be a value between 2
and 120. The default value is &quot;auto&quot; which allows
the kernel to choose a suitable value automatically.
&quot;None&quot; is equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>-R, --regionsize MirrorLogRegionSize A mirror is divided
into regions of this size (in MB), and the mirror log uses
this granularity to track which regions are in sync.</p>

<p>-s, --snapshot OriginalLogicalVolume{Name|Path}</p>

<p>Create a snapshot logical volume (or snapshot) for an
existing, so called original logical volume (or origin).
Snapshots pro- vide a frozen image of the contents of the
origin while the origin can still be updated. They enable
consistent backups and online recovery of
removed/overwritten data/files. Thin snap- shot is created
when the origin is a thin volume and the size is not
specified. Thin snapshot shares same blocks within the thin
pool volume. The snapshot with the specified size does not
need the same amount of storage the origin has. In a typical
sce- nario, 15-20% might be enough. In case the snapshot
runs out of storage, use lvextend(8) to grow it. Shrinking a
snapshot is supported by lvreduce(8) as well. Run
lvdisplay(8) on the snap- shot in order to check how much
data is allocated to it. Note that a small amount of the
space you allocate to the snapshot is used to track the
locations of the chunks of data, so you should allocate
slightly more space than you actually need and monitor the
rate at which the snapshot data is growing so you can avoid
running out of space.</p>

<p>-T, --thin, --thinpool ThinPoolLogicalVolume{Name|Path}
Creates thin pool or thin logical volume or both. Specifying
the optional argument --size will cause the creation of the
thin pool logical volume. Specifying the optional argument
--virtualsize will cause the creation of the thin logical
volume from given thin pool volume. Specifying both
arguments will cause the creation of both thin pool and thin
volume using this pool. Requires device mapper kernel driver
for thin provision- ing from kernel 3.2 or newer. Note: Thin
types are currently considered Tech Preview. For more
information on Tech Preview features, visit:
https://access.redhat.com/support/offer-
ings/techpreview/.</p>

<p>--type SegmentType Create a logical volume that uses the
specified segment type (e.g. &quot;raid5&quot;,
&quot;mirror&quot;, &quot;snapshot&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;,
&quot;thin-pool&quot;). Many segment types have a
commandline switch alias that will enable their use (-s is
an alias for --type snapshot). However, this argument must
be used when no existing commandline switch alias is
available for the desired type, as is the case with
&quot;error&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;, &quot;raid1&quot;,
&quot;raid4&quot;, &quot;raid5&quot;, or
&quot;raid6&quot;.</p>

<p>-V, --virtualsize VirtualSize[bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE] Create a
sparse device of the given size (in MB by default) using a
snapshot or thinly provisioned device when thin pool is
specified. Anything written to the device will be returned
when reading from it. Reading from other areas of the device
will return blocks of zeros. Virtual snapshot is implemented
by cre- ating a hidden virtual device of the requested size
using the zero target. A suffix of _vorigin is used for this
device.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero {y|n} Controls zeroing of the first KB of
data in the new logical vol- ume. Default is yes. Volume
will not be zeroed if read only flag is set. Snapshot
volumes are zeroed always.</p>

<p>Warning: trying to mount an unzeroed logical volume can
cause the system to hang.</p>

<p>Examples Creates a striped logical volume with 3
stripes, a stripesize of 8KB and a size of 100MB in the
volume group named vg00. The logical volume name will be
chosen by lvcreate:</p>

<p>lvcreate -i 3 -I 8 -L 100M vg00</p>

<p>Creates a mirror logical volume with 2 sides with a
useable size of 500 MiB. This operation would require 3
devices (or option --alloc any- where) - two for the mirror
devices and one for the disk log.</p>

<p>lvcreate -m1 -L 500M vg00</p>

<p>Creates a mirror logical volume with 2 sides with a
useable size of 500 MiB. This operation would require 2
devices - the log is &quot;in-memory&quot;.</p>

<p>lvcreate -m1 --mirrorlog core -L 500M vg00</p>

<p>Creates a snapshot logical volume named /dev/vg00/snap
which has access to the contents of the original logical
volume named /dev/vg00/lvol1 at snapshot logical volume
creation time. If the original logical volume contains a
file system, you can mount the snapshot logical volume on an
arbitrary directory in order to access the contents of the
filesystem to run a backup while the original filesystem
continues to get updated.</p>

<p>lvcreate --size 100m --snapshot --name snap
/dev/vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Creates a sparse device named /dev/vg1/sparse of size
1TB with space for just under 100MB of actual data on
it.</p>

<p>lvcreate --virtualsize 1T --size 100M --snapshot --name
sparse vg1</p>

<p>Creates a linear logical volume &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot;
using physical extents /dev/sda:0-7 and /dev/sdb:0-7 for
allocation of extents.</p>

<p>lvcreate -L 64M -n lvol1 vg00 /dev/sda:0-7
/dev/sdb:0-7</p>

<p>Creates a 5GiB RAID5 logical volume
&quot;vg00/my_lv&quot;, with 3 stripes (plus a parity drive
for a total of 4 devices) and a stripesize of 64kiB.</p>

<p>lvcreate --type raid5 -L 5G -i 3 -I 64 -n my_lv vg00</p>

<p>Creates 100MiB pool logical volume for thin provisioning
build with 2 stripes 64KiB and chunk size 128KiB together
with 1TiB thin provisioned logical volume
&quot;vg00/thin_lv&quot;.</p>

<p>lvcreate -i 2 -I 64 -c 256 -L100M -T vg00/pool -V 1T
--name thin_lv</p>
