<p>DESCRIPTION lvconvert is used to change the segment type
(i.e. linear, mirror, etc) or characteristics of a logical
volume. For example, it can add or remove the redundant
images of a logical volume, change the log type of a mirror,
or designate a logical volume as a snapshot repository. If
the conversion requires allocation of physical extents (for
example, when converting from linear to mirror) and you
specify one or more PhysicalVolumes (optionally with ranges
of physical extents), alloca- tion of physical extents will
be restricted to these physical extents. If the conversion
frees physical extents (for example, when converting from a
mirror to a linear, or reducing mirror legs) and you specify
one or more PhysicalVolumes, the freed extents come first
from the speci- fied PhysicalVolumes.</p>

<p>OPTIONS See lvm(8) for common options. Exactly one of
--merge, --mirrors, --repair, --replace , --snapshot,
--splitmirrors or --thinpool arguments is required.</p>

<p>-m, --mirrors Mirrors Specifies the degree of the mirror
you wish to create. For example, &quot;-m 1&quot; would
convert the original logical volume to a mirror volume with
2-sides; that is, a linear volume plus one copy.</p>

<p>--mirrorlog {disk|core|mirrored} Specifies the type of
log to use. The default is disk, which is persistent and
requires a small amount of storage space, usually on a
separate device from the data being mirrored. Core may be
useful for short-lived mirrors: It means the mirror is
regener- ated by copying the data from the first device
again every time the device is activated - perhaps, for
example, after every reboot. Using &quot;mirrored&quot; will
create a persistent log that is itself mirrored.</p>

<p>--corelog The optional argument --corelog is the same as
specifying --mir- rorlog core.</p>

<p>-R, --regionsize MirrorLogRegionSize A mirror is divided
into regions of this size (in MB), and the mirror log uses
this granularity to track which regions are in sync.</p>

<p>--type SegmentType Used to convert a logical volume to
another segment type or to explicitly state the desired
RAID1 segment type (mirror or raid1) when converting a
linear logical volume to a mirror with the -m argument.</p>

<p>-b, --background Run the daemon in the background.</p>

<p>-i, --interval Seconds Report progress as a percentage
at regular intervals.</p>

<p>--noudevsync Disable udev synchronisation. The process
will not wait for notification from udev. It will continue
irrespective of any possible udev processing in the
background. You should only use this if udev is not running
or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.</p>

<p>--splitmirrors Images The number of redundant Images of
a mirror to be split off and used to form a new logical
volume. A name must be supplied for the newly-split-off
logical volume using the --name argument, unless the
--trackchanges argument is given.</p>

<p>-n Name The name to apply to a logical volume which has
been split off from a mirror logical volume.</p>

<p>--trackchanges Used with --splitmirrors on a raid1
device, this tracks changes so that the read-only detached
image can be merged efficiently back into the mirror later.
Only the regions of the detatched device where the data
changed get resynchronized.</p>

<p>Please note that this feature is only supported with the
new md- based mirror implementation and not with the
original device- mapper mirror implementation.</p>

<p>-s, --snapshot Create a snapshot from existing logical
volume using another existing logical volume as its
origin.</p>

<p>-c, --chunksize ChunkSize[bBsSkKmMgG] Gives the size of
chunk for snapshot and thin pool logical vol- umes. For
snapshots the value must be power of 2 between 4KiB and
512KiB and the default value is 4. For thin pools the value
must be between 64KiB and 1GiB and the default value starts
with 64 and scales up to fit the pool metadata size within
128MB, if the pool metadata size is not specified. Older dm
thin pool target version (&lt;1.4) requires the value to be
power of 2. The newer version requires to be the multiple of
64KiB, however dis- card is not supported for non power of 2
values. Default unit is in kilobytes.</p>

<p>--discards {ignore|nopassdown|passdown} Sets discards
behavior for thin pool. Default is passdown.</p>

<p>-Z, --zero {y|n} Controls zeroing of the first KB of
data in the snapshot. If the volume is read-only the
snapshot will not be zeroed. For thin pool volumes it
controls zeroing of provisioned blocks. Note: Provisioning
of large zeroed chunks impacts performance.</p>

<p>--merge Merges a snapshot into its origin volume or
merges a raid1 image that has been split from its mirror
with --trackchanges back into its mirror.</p>

<p>To check if your kernel supports the snapshot merge
feature, look for snapshot-merge in the output of dmsetup
targets. If both the origin and snapshot volume are not open
the merge will start immediately. Otherwise, the merge will
start the first time either the origin or snapshot are
activated and both are closed. Merging a snapshot into an
origin that cannot be closed, for example a root filesystem,
is deferred until the next time the origin volume is
activated. When merging starts, the resulting logical volume
will have the origins name, minor number and UUID. While the
merge is in progress, reads or writes to the origin appear
as they were directed to the snap- shot being merged. When
the merge finishes, the merged snapshot is removed. Multiple
snapshots may be specified on the command- line or a @tag
may be used to specify multiple snapshots be merged to their
respective origin.</p>

<p>--poolmetadata ThinPoolMetadataLogicalVolume{Name|Path}
Specifies thin pool metadata logical volume. The size should
be in between 2MiB and 16GiB. Thin pool is specified with
the option --thinpool. When the specified thin pool already
exists, the thin pools metadata volume will be swapped with
the given LV. Properties of the thin pool like chunk size,
discards or zero are preserved by default in this case. It
can be useful for thin pool metadata repair or its offline
resize, since the content of metadata becomes accessible for
thin provisioning tools thin_dump(8) and
thin_restore(8).</p>

<p>--poolmetadatasize ThinPoolMetadataSize[bBsSkKmMgG] Sets
the size of thin pool s metadata logical volume, if the pool
metadata volume is undefined. Thin pool is specified with
the option --thinpool. Supported value is in the range
between 2MiB and 16GiB. The default value is estimated with
this for- mula (Pool_LV_size / Pool_LV_chunk_size * 64b).
Default unit is megabytes.</p>

<p>-r, --readahead {ReadAheadSectors|auto|none} Sets read
ahead sector count of thin pool metadata logical vol- ume.
The default value is &quot;auto&quot; which allows the
kernel to choose a suitable value automatically.
&quot;None&quot; is equivalent to specifying zero.</p>

<p>--repair Repair a mirror after suffering a disk failure.
The mirror will be brought back into a consistent state. By
default, the original number of mirrors will be restored if
possible. Spec- ify -y on the command line to skip the
prompts. Use -f if you do not want any replacement.
Additionally, you may use --use-poli- cies to use the device
replacement policy specified in lvm.conf(5), viz.
activation/mirror_log_fault_policy or activa-
tion/mirror_device_fault_policy.</p>

<p>--replace PhysicalVolume Remove the specified device
(PhysicalVolume) and replace it with one that is available
in the volume group or from the specific list provided. This
option is only available to RAID segment types (e.g.
&quot;raid1&quot;, &quot;raid5&quot;, etc).</p>

<p>--stripes Stripes Gives the number of stripes. This is
equal to the number of physical volumes to scatter the
logical volume.</p>

<p>-I, --stripesize StripeSize Gives the number of
kilobytes for the granularity of the stripes. StripeSize
must be 2^n (n = 2 to 9) for metadata in LVM1 format. For
metadata in LVM2 format, the stripe size may be a larger
power of 2 but must not exceed the physical extent size.</p>

<p>--thinpool ThinPoolLogicalVolume{Name|Path} Changes
logical volume into a thin pool volume. The volume will
store the pools data. Thin pool metadata logical volume can
be specified with the option --poolmetadata or allocated
with --poolmetadatasize.</p>

<p>Examples Converts the linear logical volume
&quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; to a two-way mirror logical
volume:</p>

<p>lvconvert -m1 vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Converts the linear logical volume
&quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; to a two-way RAID1 log- ical
volume:</p>

<p>lvconvert --type raid1 -m1 vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Converts a mirror with a disk log to a mirror with an
in-memory log:</p>

<p>lvconvert --mirrorlog core vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Converts a mirror with an in-memory log to a mirror with
a disk log:</p>

<p>lvconvert --mirrorlog disk vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Converts a mirror logical volume to a linear logical
volume:</p>

<p>lvconvert -m0 vg00/lvol1</p>

<p>Converts a mirror logical volume to a RAID1 logical
volume with the same number of images:</p>

<p>lvconvert --type raid1 vg00/mirror_lv</p>

<p>Converts logical volume &quot;vg00/lvol2&quot; to
snapshot of original volume &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot;:</p>

<p>lvconvert -s vg00/lvol1 vg00/lvol2</p>

<p>Converts linear logical volume &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot; to
a two-way mirror, using physical extents /dev/sda:0-15 and
/dev/sdb:0-15 for allocation of new extents:</p>

<p>lvconvert -m1 vg00/lvol1 /dev/sda:0-15 /dev/sdb:0-15</p>

<p>Converts mirror logical volume
&quot;vg00/lvmirror1&quot; to linear, freeing physical
extents from /dev/sda:</p>

<p>lvconvert -m0 vg00/lvmirror1 /dev/sda</p>

<p>Merges &quot;vg00/lvol1_snap&quot; into its origin:</p>

<p>lvconvert --merge vg00/lvol1_snap</p>

<p>If &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot;, &quot;vg00/lvol2&quot; and
&quot;vg00/lvol3&quot; are all tagged with
&quot;some_tag&quot; each snapshot logical volume will be
merged serially, e.g.: &quot;vg00/lvol1&quot;, then
&quot;vg00/lvol2&quot;, then &quot;vg00/lvol3&quot;. If
--background were used it would start all snapshot logical
volume merges in paral- lel.</p>

<p>lvconvert --merge @some_tag</p>

<p>Extracts one image from the mirror, making it a new
logical volume named &quot;lv_split&quot;. The mirror the
image is extracted from is reduced accordingly. If it was a
2-way mirror (created with -m 1 ), then the resulting
original volume will be linear.</p>

<p>lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --name lv_split
vg00/lvmirror1</p>

<p>A mirrored logical volume created with --type raid1 can
use the --trackchanges argument when splitting off an image.
Detach one image from the mirrored logical volume lv_raid1
as a separate read-only device and track the changes made to
the mirror while it is detached. The split-off device has a
name of the form lv_raid1_rimage_N, where N is a number, and
it cannot be renamed.</p>

<p>lvconvert --splitmirrors 1 --trackchanges
vg00/lv_raid1</p>

<p>Merge an image that was detached temporarily from its
mirror with the --trackchanges argument back into its
original mirror and bring its contents back up-to-date.</p>

<p>lvconvert --merge vg00/lv_raid1_rimage_1</p>

<p>Replaces the physical volume &quot;/dev/sdb1&quot; in
the RAID1 logical volume &quot;my_raid1&quot; with the
specified physical volume &quot;/dev/sdf1&quot;. Had the
argument &quot;/dev/sdf1&quot; been left out, lvconvert
would attempt to find a suitable device from those available
in the volume group.</p>

<p>lvconvert --replace /dev/sdb1 vg00/my_raid1
/dev/sdf1</p>
