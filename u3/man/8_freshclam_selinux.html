<p>freshclam_selinux(8)freshclam SELinux Policy
documentationfreshclam_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME freshclam_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the freshclam processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have
an extended attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux freshclam policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their freshclam processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for freshclam:</p>

<p>freshclam_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the freshclam_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the freshclam_t domain.</p>

<p>freshclam_var_log_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the freshclam_var_log_t type, if you
want to treat the data as freshclam var log data, usually
stored under the /var/log directory.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux freshclam policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their fresh- clam processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
freshclam:</p>

<p>freshclam_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
