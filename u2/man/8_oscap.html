<p>NAME oscap - OpenSCAP command line tool</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS oscap [general-options] module operation
[operation-options-and-argu- ments]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION oscap is Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP) toolkit based on OpenSCAP library. It
provides various functions for different SCAP
specifications(modules).</p>

<p>GENERAL OPTIONS -V, --version SCAP specification
supported by the module.</p>

<p>-q, --quiet No output for certain operations, only
return code.</p>

<p>-h, --help Help screen.</p>

<p>MODULES oval Open Vulnerability and Assessment
Language.</p>

<p>cvss Common Vulnerability Scoring System</p>

<p>OVAL OPERATIONS collect [options] definitions-file Probe
the system and gather system characteristics for all objects
in OVAL Definition file.</p>

<p>--id OBJECT-ID Collect system characteristics ONLY for
specified OVAL Object.</p>

<p>--variables FILE Provide external variables expected by
OVAL Definitions.</p>

<p>--syschar FILE Write OVAL System Characteristic into
file</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>eval [options] definitions-file Probe the system and
evaluate all definitions from OVAL Defini- tion file. Print
result of each definition to standard output. oscap returns
0 if all definitions pass. If there is an error during
evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at least one
failed result definition, oscap-scan finishes with return
code 2.</p>

<p>--id DEFINITION-ID Evaluate ONLY specified OVAL
Definition.</p>

<p>--variables FILE Provide external variables expected by
OVAL Definitions.</p>

<p>--directives FILE Use OVAL Directives content to specify
desired results content.</p>

<p>--results FILE Write OVAL Results into file.</p>

<p>--report FILE Create human readable (HTML) report from
OVAL Results.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>analyse [options] --results FILE definitions-file
syschar-file In this mode, the oscap tool does not perform
data collection on the local system, but relies upon the
input file, which may have been generated on another system.
The output (OVAL Results) is printed to file specified by
--results parameter</p>

<p>--variables FILE Provide external variables expected by
OVAL Definitions.</p>

<p>--directives FILE Use OVAL Directives content to specify
desired results content.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>validate-xml [options] definitions-file Validate given
OVAL file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed
to the standard output. Return code is 0 if valida- tion
succeeds, 1 if validation could not be performed due to some
error, 2 if the OVAL document is not valid.</p>

<p>--definitions, --variables, --syschar, --results
--directives Specify whether the validated document is an
OVAL Defini- tions file, external OVAL Variables, OVAL
System Charac- teristics file, OVAL Results file or OVAL
Directives file. Default: definitions.</p>

<p>--schematron Turn on Schematron-based validation. It is
able to find more errors and inconsistencies but is much
slower.</p>

<p>generate &lt;submodule&gt; [submodule-specific-options]
Generate another document form an OVAL file.</p>

<p>Available submodules:</p>

<p>report [options] oval-results-file Generate a formatted
HTML page containing visualisation of an OVAL results file.
Unless the --output option is specified it will be written
to the standard output.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the report to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>list-probes [options] List supported object types (i.e.
probes)</p>

<p>--static List all probes defined in the internal
tables.</p>

<p>--dynamic List all probes supported on the current
system (this is default behavior).</p>

<p>--verbose Be verbose.</p>

<p>XCCDF OPERATIONS eval [options] xccdf-file
[oval-definitions-files] Perform evaluation driven by XCCDF
file and use OVAL as checking engine. Print result of each
rule to standard output. oscap returns 0 if all rules pass.
If there is an error during evalua- tion, the return code is
1. If there is at least one failed rule, oscap-scan finishes
with return code 2.</p>

<p>You may specify all required OVAL Definition files as
last parameters. If you dont do that, oscap tool will try to
load all OVAL Definition files referenced from XCCDF
automati- caly(search in the same path as XCCDF).</p>

<p>--profile PROFILE Select a particular profile from XCCDF
document.</p>

<p>--results FILE Write XCCDF results into file.</p>

<p>--report FILE Write HTML report into file. You also have
to specify --result for this feature to work.</p>

<p>--oval-results Generate OVAL Result file for each OVAL
session used for evaluation. File with name
original-oval-definitions- filename.result.xml will be
generated for each refer- enced OVAL file. This option (with
conjunction with the --report option) also enables inclusion
of additional OVAL information in the XCCDF report.</p>

<p>--export-variables Generate OVAL Variables documents
which contain external variables values that were provided
to the OVAL checking engine during evaluation. The filename
format is origi-
nal-oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-
variables-index.xml.</p>

<p>--skip-valid Do not validate input/output files.</p>

<p>resolve -o output-file xccdf-file Resolve an XCCDF file
as described in the XCCDF specification. It will flatten
inheritance hierarchy of XCCDF profiles, groups, rules, and
values. Result is another XCCDF document, which will be
written to output-file.</p>

<p>--force Force resolving XCCDF document even if it is
already marked as resolved.</p>

<p>validate-xml [options] xccdf-file Validate given XCCDF
file against a XML schema. Every found error is printed to
the standard output. Return code is 0 if validation
succeeds, 1 if validation could not be performed due to some
error, 2 if the XCCDF document is not valid.</p>

<p>export-oval-variables [options] xccdf-file
[oval-definitions-files] Collect all the XCCDF values that
would be used by OVAL during evaluation of a certain profile
and export them as OVAL exter- nal-variables document(s).
The filename format is original-
oval-definitions-filename-session-index.variables-variables-
index.xml.</p>

<p>--profile PROFILE Select a particular profile from XCCDF
document.</p>

<p>generate [options] &lt;submodule&gt;
[submodule-specific-options] Generate another document form
an XCCDF file such as security guide or result report.</p>

<p>--profile ID Apply profile with given ID to the
Benchmark before fur- ther processing takes place.</p>

<p>--format FMT Specify output format. This option applies
only on docu- ment generators (i.e. guide, report). Avalable
formats: html (default), docbook.</p>

<p>Available submodules:</p>

<p>guide [options] xccdf-file Generate a formatted document
containing a security guide from a XCCDF Benchmark. Unless
the --output option is specified it will be written to the
standard output. Without profile being set only groups (not
rules) will be included in the output.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the guide to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--hide-profile-info Information on chosen profile (e.g.
rules selected by the profile) will be excluded from the
document.</p>

<p>report [options] xccdf-file Generate a document
containing results of a XCCDF Bench- mark execution. Unless
the --output option is specified it will be written to the
standard output. ID of the TestResult element to visualise
defaults to the most recent result (according to the
end-time attribute).</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the report to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--result-id ID ID of the XCCDF TestResult from which the
report will be generated.</p>

<p>--show what Specify what result types shall be displayed
in the result report. The default is to show every- thing
except for rules with results notselected and notapplicable.
The what part is a comma-sepa- rated list of result types to
display in addition to the default. If result type is
prefixed by a dash -, it will be excluded from the results.
If what is prefixed by an equality sign =, a following list
specifies exactly what rule types to include in the report.
Result types are: pass, fixed, notchecked, notapplicable,
notselected, informational, unknown, error, fail.</p>

<p>--oval-template template-string To use the ability to
include additional informa- tion from OVAL in xccdf result
file, a template which will be used to obtain OVAL result
file names has to be specified. The template can be either a
filename or a string containing wildcard character (percent
sign % ). Wildcard will be replaced by the original OVAL
definition file name as referenced from the XCCDF file. This
way it is possible to obtain OVAL information even from
XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To use this
option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify
%.result.xml as a OVAL file name template.</p>

<p>fix [options] xccdf-file Generate a script that shall
bring the system to a state of compliance with given XCCDF
Benchmark.</p>

<p>--output FILE Write the report to this file instead of
standard output.</p>

<p>--result-id ID With this option the script generating
engine will pick rules that failed for given test and
generate fixes only for them.</p>

<p>--template ID|FILE Template to be used to generate the
script. If it contains a dot . it is interpreted as a loca-
tion of a file with the template definition. Oth- erwise it
identifies a template from standard set which currently
includes: bash (default if no --template switch present).
Brief explanation of the process of writing your own
templates is in the XSL file xsl/fix.xsl in the openscap
data directory. You can also take a look at the default
template xsl/fixtpl-bash.xml.</p>

<p>CPE OPERATIONS check name Check whether name is in
correct CPE format.</p>

<p>match name dictionary.xml Find an exact match of CPE
name in the dictionary.</p>

<p>CVSS OPERATIONS score cvss_vector Calculate score from a
CVSS vector. Prints base score for base CVSS vector, base
and temporal score for temporal CVSS vector, base and
temporal and environmental score for environmental CVSS
vector.</p>

<p>describe cvss_vector Describe individual components of a
CVSS vector in a human-read- able format and print partial
scores.</p>

<p>CVSS vector consists of several slash-separated
components specified as key-value pairs. Each key can be
specified at most once. Valid CVSS vector has to contain at
least base CVSS metrics, i.e. AV, AC, AU, C, I, and A.
Following table summarizes the components and possible
values (second column is metric category: B for base, T for
temporal, E for environmental):</p>
