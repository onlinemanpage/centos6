<p>virt-inspector2(1) Virtualization Support
virt-inspector2(1)</p>

<p>NAME virt-inspector2 - Display operating system version
and other information about a virtual machine</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS virt-inspector2 [--options] -d domname</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 [--options] -a disk.img [-a disk.img
...]</p>

<p>Old-style:</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 domname</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION virt-inspector2 examines a virtual machine
or disk image and tries to determine the version of the
operating system and other information about the virtual
machine.</p>

<p>Virt-inspector2 produces XML output for feeding into
other programs.</p>

<p>In the normal usage, use &quot;virt-inspector2 -d
domname&quot; where &quot;domname&quot; is the libvirt
domain (see: &quot;virsh list --all&quot;).</p>

<p>You can also run virt-inspector2 directly on disk images
from a single virtual machine. Use &quot;virt-inspector2 -a
disk.img&quot;. In rare cases a domain has several block
devices, in which case you should list several -a options
one after another, with the first corresponding to the
guests &quot;/dev/sda&quot;, the second to the guests
&quot;/dev/sdb&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>Virt-inspector2 can only inspect and report upon one
domain at a time. To inspect several virtual machines, you
have to run virt-inspector2 several times (for example, from
a shell script for-loop).</p>

<p>Because virt-inspector2 needs direct access to guest
images, it wont normally work over remote libvirt
connections.</p>

<p>OPTIONS --help Display brief help.</p>

<p>-a file --add file Add file which should be a disk image
from a virtual machine. If the virtual machine has multiple
block devices, you must supply all of them with separate -a
options.</p>

<p>The format of the disk image is auto-detected. To
override this and force a particular format use the
--format=.. option.</p>

<p>-c URI --connect URI If using libvirt, connect to the
given URI. If omitted, then we connect to the default
libvirt hypervisor.</p>

<p>Libvirt is only used if you specify a
&quot;domname&quot; on the command line. If you specify
guest block devices directly (-a), then libvirt is not used
at all.</p>

<p>-d guest --domain guest Add all the disks from the named
libvirt guest.</p>

<p>--echo-keys When prompting for keys and passphrases,
virt-inspector2 normally turns echoing off so you cannot see
what you are typing. If you are not worried about Tempest
attacks and there is no one else in the room you can specify
this flag to see what you are typing.</p>

<p>--format=raw|qcow2|.. --format Specify the format of
disk images given on the command line. If this is omitted
then the format is autodetected from the content of the disk
image.</p>

<p>If disk images are requested from libvirt, then this
program asks libvirt for this information. In this case, the
value of the format parameter is ignored.</p>

<p>If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images,
you should ensure the format is always specified.</p>

<p>--keys-from-stdin Read key or passphrase parameters from
stdin. The default is to try to read passphrases from the
user by opening &quot;/dev/tty&quot;.</p>

<p>-v --verbose Enable verbose messages for debugging.</p>

<p>-V --version Display version number and exit.</p>

<p>-x Enable tracing of libguestfs API calls.</p>

<p>OLD-STYLE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS Previous versions of
virt-inspector2 allowed you to write either:</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 disk.img [disk.img ...]</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>virt-inspector2 guestname</p>

<p>whereas in this version you should use -a or -d
respectively to avoid the confusing case where a disk image
might have the same name as a guest.</p>

<p>For compatibility the old style is still supported.</p>

<p>XML FORMAT The virt-inspector2 XML is described
precisely in a RELAX NG schema which is supplied with
libguestfs. This section is just an overview.</p>

<p>The top-level element is &lt;operatingsystems&gt;, and
it contains one or more &lt;operatingsystem&gt; elements.
You would only see more than one &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
element if the virtual machine is multi-boot, which is
vanishingly rare in real world VMs.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystem&gt; In the &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
tag are various optional fields that describe the operating
system, its architecture, the descriptive &quot;product
name&quot; string, the type of OS and so on, as in this
example:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt;
&lt;root&gt;/dev/sda2&lt;/root&gt;
&lt;name&gt;windows&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;arch&gt;i386&lt;/arch&gt;
&lt;distro&gt;windows&lt;/distro&gt;
&lt;product_name&gt;Windows 7
Enterprise&lt;/product_name&gt;
&lt;major_version&gt;6&lt;/major_version&gt;
&lt;minor_version&gt;1&lt;/minor_version&gt;
&lt;windows_systemroot&gt;/Windows&lt;/windows_systemroot&gt;</p>

<p>These fields are derived from the libguestfs inspection
API, and you can find more details in &quot;INSPECTION&quot;
in guestfs(3).</p>

<p>The &lt;root&gt; element is the root filesystem device,
but from the point of view of libguestfs (block devices may
have completely different names inside the VM itself).</p>

<p>&lt;mountpoints&gt; Un*x-like guests typically have
multiple filesystems which are mounted at various
mountpoints, and these are described in the
&lt;mountpoints&gt; element which looks like this:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;mountpoints&gt; &lt;mountpoint
dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;/&lt;/mountpoint&gt;
&lt;mountpoint
dev=&quot;/dev/sda1&quot;&gt;/boot&lt;/mountpoint&gt;
&lt;/mountpoints&gt;</p>

<p>As with &lt;root&gt;, devices are from the point of view
of libguestfs, and may have completely different names
inside the guest. Only mountable filesystems appear in this
list, not things like swap devices.</p>

<p>&lt;filesystems&gt; &lt;filesystems&gt; is like
&lt;mountpoints&gt; but covers all filesystems belonging to
the guest, including swap and empty partitions. (In the rare
case of a multi-boot guest, it covers filesystems belonging
to this OS or shared by this OS and other OSes).</p>

<p>You might see something like this:</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;filesystems&gt; &lt;filesystem
dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;
&lt;type&gt;ext4&lt;/type&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Fedora-13-x86_64&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;uuid&gt;e6a4db1e-15c2-477b-ac2a-699181c396aa&lt;/uuid&gt;
&lt;/filesystem&gt;</p>

<p>The optional elements within &lt;filesystem&gt; are the
filesystem type, the label, and the UUID.</p>

<p>&lt;applications&gt; The related elements
&lt;package_format&gt;, &lt;package_management&gt; and
&lt;applications&gt; describe applications installed in the
virtual machine.</p>

<p>&lt;package_format&gt;, if present, describes the
packaging system used. Typical values would be
&quot;rpm&quot; and &quot;deb&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;package_management&gt;, if present, describes the
package manager. Typical values include &quot;yum&quot;,
&quot;up2date&quot; and &quot;apt&quot;</p>

<p>&lt;applications&gt; lists the packages or applications
installed.</p>

<p>&lt;operatingsystems&gt; &lt;operatingsystem&gt; ...
&lt;applications&gt; &lt;application&gt;
&lt;name&gt;coreutils&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;version&gt;8.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;release&gt;1&lt;/release&gt; &lt;/application&gt;</p>

<p>The version and release fields may not be available for
some types guests. Other fields are possible, see
&quot;guestfs_inspect_list_applications&quot; in
guestfs(3).</p>

<p>USING XPATH You can use the XPath query language, and/or
the xpath tool, in order to select parts of the XML.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>$ virt-inspector2 -d Guest | xpath //filesystems Found 1
nodes: -- NODE -- &lt;filesystems&gt; &lt;filesystem
dev=&quot;/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root&quot;&gt;
&lt;type&gt;ext4&lt;/type&gt; [etc]</p>

<p>$ virt-inspector2 -d Guest | xpath
&quot;string(//filesystem[@dev=&rsquo;/dev/sda1&rsquo;]/type)&quot;
Query didn&rsquo;t return a nodeset. Value: ext4</p>

<p>SHELL QUOTING Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary
characters, some of which have meaning to the shell such as
&quot;#&quot; and space. You may need to quote or escape
these characters on the command line. See the shell manual
page sh(1) for details.</p>
