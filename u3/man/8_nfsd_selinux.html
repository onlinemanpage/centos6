<p>nfsd_selinux(8) nfsd SELinux Policy documentation
nfsd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME nfsd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the nfsd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable
based on least access required. nfsd policy is extremely
flexible and has several booleans that allow you to
manipulate the policy and run nfsd with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow virt to manage nfs file, you must
turn on the virt_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to support NFS home directorie, you must
turn on the use_nfs_home_dirs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P use_nfs_home_dirs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow xen to manage nfs file, you must
turn on the xen_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xen_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow ftp servers to use nfs used for
public file trans- fer services, you must turn on the
allow_ftpd_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P allow_ftpd_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Git daemon system to access nfs
file systems, you must turn on the git_system_use_nfs
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P git_system_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow qemu to use nfs file system, you
must turn on the qemu_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P qemu_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow rsync servers to share nfs files
system, you must turn on the rsync_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P rsync_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow Cobbler to access nfs file systems,
you must turn on the cobbler_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P cobbler_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow httpd to access nfs file system,
you must turn on the httpd_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P httpd_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow sge to access nfs file systems, you
must turn on the sge_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sge_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage
nfs file, you must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow samba to export NFS volumes, you
must turn on the samba_share_nfs boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P samba_share_nfs 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux nfsd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their nfsd processes in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for nfsd:</p>

<p>nfs_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nfs_t type, if you want to treat
the files as nfs data.</p>

<p>nfsd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nfsd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the nfsd_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd, /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd</p>

<p>nfsd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nfsd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transition an executable to the nfsd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>nfsd_ro_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nfsd_ro_t type, if you want to
treat the files as nfsd read/only content.</p>

<p>nfsd_rw_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the nfsd_rw_t type, if you want to
treat the files as nfsd read/write content.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux nfsd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their nfsd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for nfsd:</p>

<p>nfsd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
