<p>NAME cfengine_serverd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux
Policy for the cfengine_serverd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the
cfengine_serverd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.</p>

<p>The cfengine_serverd processes execute with the
cfengine_serverd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have
these processes running by exe- cuting the ps command with
the -Z qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep cfengine_serverd_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The cfengine_serverd_t SELinux type can be
entered via the
&quot;mtrr_device_t,unlabeled_t,proc_type,sysctl_type,filesys-
tem_type,file_type,cfengine_serverd_exec_t&quot; file types.
The default entrypoint paths for the cfengine_serverd_t
domain are the following:&quot;</p>

<p>/dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system,
/usr/sbin/cf-serverd</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux cfengine_serverd policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their cfengine_serverd processes in
as secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
cfengine_serverd:</p>

<p>cfengine_serverd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a cfengine_serverd_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type cfengine_serverd_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux cfengine_serverd policy is very
flexible allowing users to setup their cfengine_serverd
processes in as secure a method as possi- ble.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for
cfengine_serverd:</p>

<p>cfengine_serverd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the cfengine_serverd_exec_t type, if
you want to tran- sition an executable to the
cfengine_serverd_t domain.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type
cfengine_serverd_t can manage files labeled with the
following file types. The paths listed are the default paths
for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to
have DAC permissions.</p>

<p>file_type</p>

<p>all files on the system</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
