<p>NAME sssd - System Security Services Daemon</p>

<p>SYNOPSIS sssd [options]</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage
access to remote directories and authentication mechanisms.
It provides an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a
pluggable backend system to connect to multiple different
account sources as well as D-Bus interface. It is also the
basis to provide client auditing and policy services for
projects like FreeIPA. It provides a more robust database to
store local users as well as extended user data.</p>

<p>OPTIONS -d,--debug-level LEVEL Debug level to run the
daemon with. 0 is the default as well as the lowest allowed
value, 10 is the most verbose mode. This setting overrides
the settings from config file. This parameter implies
-i.</p>

<p>debug_timestamps (bool) Add a timestamp to the debug
messages</p>

<p>Default: false</p>

<p>-f,--debug-to-files Send the debug output to files
instead of stderr. By default, the log files are stored in
/var/log/sssd and there are separate log files for every
SSSD service and domain.</p>

<p>-D,--daemon Become a daemon after starting up.</p>

<p>-i,--interactive Run in the foreground, don&acute;t
become a daemon.</p>

<p>-c,--config Specify a non-default config file. The
default is /etc/sssd/sssd.conf. For reference on the config
file syntax and options, consult the sssd.conf(5) manual
page.</p>

<p>-h,--help Display help message and exit.</p>

<p>SIGNALS SIGTERM/SIGINT Informs the SSSD to gracefully
terminate all of its child processes and then shut down the
monitor.</p>

<p>SIGHUP Tells the SSSD to stop writing to its current
debug file descriptors and to close and reopen them. This is
meant to facilitate log rolling with programs like
logrotate.</p>

<p>SIGUSR1 Tells the SSSD to simulate offline operation for
one minute. This is mostly useful for testing purposes.</p>

<p>SIGUSR2 Tells the SSSD to go online immediately. This is
mostly useful for testing purposes.</p>
