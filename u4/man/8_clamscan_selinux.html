<p>clamscan_selinux(8)SELinux Policy documentation for
clamscaclamscan_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME clamscan_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the clamscan pro- cesses</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamscan
processes via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>The clamscan processes execute with the clamscan_t
SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes
running by executing the ps com- mand with the -Z
qualifier.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>ps -eZ | grep clamscan_t</p>

<p>ENTRYPOINTS The clamscan_t SELinux type can be entered
via the &quot;clamscan_exec_t&quot; file type. The default
entrypoint paths for the clamscan_t domain are the
following:&quot;</p>

<p>/usr/bin/clamscan, /usr/bin/clamdscan</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux clamscan policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their clamscan processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
clamscan:</p>

<p>clamscan_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a clamscan_t</p>

<p>can be used to make the process type clamscan_t
permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access
by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. clam- scan policy is extremely flexible and
has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy
and run clamscan with the tightest access possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a
system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1</p>

<p>If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a
system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system
boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux clamscan policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their clamscan processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for clamscan:</p>

<p>clamscan_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamscan_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the clamscan_t domain.</p>

<p>clamscan_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the clamscan_tmp_t type, if you want to
store clamscan temporary files in the /tmp directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>MANAGED FILES The SELinux process type clamscan_t can
manage files labeled with the following file types. The
paths listed are the default paths for these file types.
Note the processes UID still need to have DAC
permissions.</p>

<p>amavis_spool_t</p>

<p>/var/spool/amavisd(/.*)?</p>

<p>antivirus_db_t</p>

<p>/var/opt/f-secure(/.*)?</p>

<p>clamd_var_lib_t</p>

<p>/var/clamav(/.*)? /var/lib/clamd.*
/var/lib/clamav(/.*)?</p>

<p>clamscan_tmp_t</p>

<p>initrc_tmp_t</p>

<p>mnt_t</p>

<p>/mnt(/[^/]*) /mnt(/[^/]*)? /rhev(/[^/]*)? /media(/[^/]*)
/media(/[^/]*)? /etc/rhgb(/.*)? /media/.hal-.* /net /afs
/misc /rhev</p>

<p>root_t</p>

<p>/ /initrd</p>

<p>tmp_t</p>

<p>/tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /var/tmp/vi.recover</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
