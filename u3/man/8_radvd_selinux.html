<p>radvd_selinux(8) radvd SELinux Policy documentation
radvd_selinux(8)</p>

<p>NAME radvd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for
the radvd processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures radvd (IPv6 router
advertisement daemon) pro- cesses via flexible mandatory
access control.</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux radvd policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their radvd processes in as secure a method
as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for radvd:</p>

<p>radvd_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radvd_etc_t type, if you want to
store radvd files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>radvd_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radvd_exec_t type, if you want to
transition an executable to the radvd_t domain.</p>

<p>radvd_initrc_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radvd_initrc_exec_t type, if you
want to transi- tion an executable to the radvd_initrc_t
domain.</p>

<p>radvd_var_run_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the radvd_var_run_t type, if you want
to store the radvd files under the /run directory.</p>

<p>Paths: /var/run/radvd(/.*)?, /var/run/radvd.pid</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux radvd policy is very flexible allowing users
to setup their radvd pro- cesses in as secure a method as
possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for radvd:</p>

<p>radvd_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
