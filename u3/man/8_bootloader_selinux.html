<p>NAME bootloader_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy
for the bootloader processes</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION SELinux Linux secures bootloader (Policy for
the kernel modules, kernel image, and bootloader) processes
via flexible mandatory access control.</p>

<p>BOOLEANS SELinux policy is customizable based on least
access required. boot- loader policy is extremely flexible
and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the
policy and run bootloader with the tightest access
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to allows xdm to execute bootloade, you must
turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.</p>

<p>setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1</p>

<p>FILE CONTEXTS SELinux requires files to have an extended
attribute to define the file type.</p>

<p>You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to
ls</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
these files. SELinux bootloader policy is very flexible
allowing users to setup their bootloader processes in as
secure a method as possible.</p>

<p>The following file types are defined for bootloader:</p>

<p>bootloader_etc_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_etc_t type, if you want
to store boot- loader files in the /etc directories.</p>

<p>Paths: /etc/yaboot.conf.*, /etc/lilo.conf.*</p>

<p>bootloader_exec_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_exec_t type, if you want
to transition an executable to the bootloader_t domain.</p>

<p>Paths: /sbin/lilo.*, /usr/sbin/grub, /sbin/ybin.*,
/sbin/grub</p>

<p>bootloader_tmp_t</p>

<p>- Set files with the bootloader_tmp_t type, if you want
to store bootloader temporary files in the /tmp
directories.</p>

<p>Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the
chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file
context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This
will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to
use restorecon to apply the labels.</p>

<p>PROCESS TYPES SELinux defines process types (domains)
for each process running on the system</p>

<p>You can see the context of a process using the -Z option
to ps</p>

<p>Policy governs the access confined processes have to
files. SELinux bootloader policy is very flexible allowing
users to setup their boot- loader processes in as secure a
method as possible.</p>

<p>The following process types are defined for
bootloader:</p>

<p>bootloader_t</p>

<p>Note: semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE can be used to
make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are
not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be
generated.</p>

<p>COMMANDS semanage fcontext can also be used to
manipulate default file context mappings.</p>

<p>semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate
whether or not a process type is permissive.</p>

<p>semanage module can also be used to
enable/disable/install/remove pol- icy modules.</p>

<p>semanage boolean can also be used to manipulate the
booleans</p>

<p>system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to
customize SELinux pol- icy settings.</p>
